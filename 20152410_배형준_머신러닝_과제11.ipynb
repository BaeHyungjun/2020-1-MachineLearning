\\nother than director russ meyer\\'s predilection for casting attractive large breasted women who ultimately expose the afore-mentioned anatomical areas , there is really only one other reason to recommend even taking a look at this movie . \\nthat is the fact that it was co-written by famed film critic roger ebert , who also was responsible for the screenplay . \\nafter watching this movie you will never be able to sit through another one of his reviews where he gives a movie a thumbs down for bad writing with a straight face . \\nthis movie stinks out loud . \\nquite frankly , this movie deserves a . \\nbut there are parts of it that are so bad they are almost funny . \\nso i\\'m giving it a . \\nand maybe that is too generous . \\nright from the opening credits , i knew that i had a class-a bomb on my hands . \\nnot only are the way the credits actually shot distracting , but the first scene you see includes a big breasted young woman being chased by a guy in a nazi uniform . \\ni had absolutely no idea why the hell that was happening ( it does get explained later ) and as soon as the first scene is over , we cut to a completely unrelated scene . \\nto be honest , as i sat through this movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was , i actually forgot about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in the film . \\nwith the quality of the writing during the rest of the film , it wouldn\\'t have surprised me if the opening had never been explained . \\nso what is this movie about ? \\nyou ask . \\nlike it really matters . \\nok , here goes . \\nthis all-girl band headed by kelly macnamara ( dolly reed ) and her friends go to hollywood to try to gain a foothold in the music industry . \\nonce there , they do manage to find success ( due as much to their hooters as anything else ? it sure wasn\\'t for their brutally bad singing voices ) , and the movie chronicles how their lives change for the worse as the pressures of fame get to them . \\neverything from big egos , to booze and drugs to free flowing sex sends them on a downward spiral . \\nthere are a couple of other idiotic subplots thrown in for good measure , but the fame is the one that pretty much sums up this thing . \\n>from a creative standpoint there is nothing redeeming here . \\nother than the above-mentioned obsession with big knockers that russ meyer seemed to have . \\nthe dialogue is so incredibly bad that it literally is funny in parts . \\nmr . ebert has generously thrown in helpings of \" hey man \" , \" dig \" and my all time favorite -- \" this is my happening , and it freaks me out \" . \\nnow i ask you , with lines like that how can you go wrong ? \\nebert had tried to inject as many big words as possible into the dialogue . \\nmaybe he thought it would make the movie seem smarter . \\ni don\\'t know , but all the big words in the world wouldn\\'t be able to disguise the bad writing and even worse acting . \\nbut the wretched dialogue goes along well with the wretched quality of everything else in this movie . \\ni\\'ve seen home movies directed better than meyer managed with this turkey . \\nin fact , there is one scene -- the one in which they are in a van driving to hollywood to make their fortunes -- during which i really had to question if meyer or his editors had just suffered serious head injuries . \\nadd to the directing and writing the music in this movie . \\ni almost got up to check my sound system to see if it was broken , there was such a pile of crap emanating from the speakers . \\nthen we have the cast . \\nfirst lets start david gurian who played harris , the manager of the band . \\nthis has got to be the goofiest looking guy that has ever set foot in front of a motion picture camera . \\nsadly , his acting doesn\\'t come close to making up for his looks . \\nif you have been following along up to this point , this shouldn\\'t surprise you . \\nmeyer\\'s stable of well endowed girls also have the benefit of being fairly attractive to go along with their other assets . \\ndolly reed plays kelly , the leader of the band . \\nand no surprise here , she was cast for her cup size , not her talents . \\nand yes , she does loose the shirt a few times and display her impressive talents . \\nsadly , her ass is almost as large as her chest . \\nhey , it a sexist movie , so i\\'m writing a sexist review . \\nthen we have former playboy playmate cynthia myers in a fairly small role as casey , one of the other band members . \\nthis goes along with the rest of the idiotic thinking in the movie . \\nmeyer casts a gorgeous playmate with a rack to kill for and who obviously has no acting talent at all , but her nude scenes are the biggest disappointment of all . \\nsure russ , now is the time to get artsy and throw in some well placed shadows . \\non the up side , she does have a fun lesbo scene . \\ni sound like i\\'m writing a review in a porn magazine . \\nbut hey , i\\'ll admit it ; the only reason that i actually managed to sit through this damn movie was to catch a look at cynthia myers naked . \\nand since that was a huge disappointment , i pretty much wasted two hours of my life on this turkey . \\nthe only thing that i can say about this movie is that you should stay away from it . \\nunless of course you want to feel good about yourself by knowing that even a pulitzer prize winning film critic like roger ebert has screwed up at least once in his life too . \\nand if you are thinking of checking it out for the double d\\'s -- you are better off just downloading nude cynthia myers pictures off the internet . \\nthis is a movie that should be avoided at all costs . \\nan even better idea might be to require video stores to place a warning on the box of beyond the valley of the dolls -- beware : this movie is extremely hazardous to your common sense . \\nproceed with extreme caution . \\n',\n",
       "  b'robin hood : men in tights is another mel-brooks-produced film in the classic tradition of movies like blazing saddles and young frankenstein . \\nmel brooks is well known for his comic look at regular life , his fast paced dialogue and sharp wit . \\nunfortunately , robin hood : men in tights has none of the easy going humor of blazing saddles , none of the fun acting of young frankenstein , is devoid of the charm of spaceballs , and is even lacking the good , solid dialogue of history of the world . \\nit is , in short , one of the worst movies i have seen mel brooks , or anybody else , produce . \\nthe plot borrows heavily from the well-received kevin costner movie of last year , robin hood : prince of thieves . \\nthis is not surprising in and of itself , and could have been used to great comic effect , mainly by parodying scenes from the orginal movie . \\nmel brooks does not take advantage of this , however , and uses the film to launch several ideas into the air , none of which connect and none of which are explained later on . \\nthe movie\\'s scenes could be shuffled around in any order and one would be hard pressed to notice . \\ncary elwes , of princess bride fame , plays robin of loxley , a man who was captured in the crusades , fighting with king richard . \\nhe escapes and , joining with a man named achoo ( i am sure you can see the obvious joke ) , fights in england to reclaim his name and the throne for richard , which has been captured by evil prince john , played by funny comic richard lewis . \\nhe also tries for the love of maid marian and attempts to overthrow the evil \" sheriff of rottingham \" . \\na good adventure plot that is sadly unused . \\nelwes and lewis are both excellent comics , but the dialogue in the movie is simply excruciating . \\nneither actor has any good words to work with , and the lines simply aren\\'t funny , nor believable . \\nperhaps the worst example of this is when the group of merry men encounter a man playing a macaulay culkin clone from the hit movie home alone . \\nthis particular scene is so out of place and so badly acted , and followed by so many other scenes of equal miserable ideas , that i really felt like leaving the theatre . \\nmuch of the audience continued to look at their watches throughout , and some left the theatre . \\nchuckles were few and far between , and they mostly dealt with visual jokes ( such as an old , beaten up horse from \" rent-a-wreck \" ) then from any dialogue whatsoever . \\nscenes that could have been classics , such as the archery contest , are ruined by poor acting . \\nperhaps the largest problem with the movie is that it is simply offensive . \\nthe basic plot , that robin has received a key that will unlock the chastity belt of maid marian , is not witty nor funny . \\nmel brooks as a circumcision-giving rabbi is also offensive to me and others in the audience ( not all jewish , either ) . \\nthe movie simply tries to hard trying to be funny and by and large fails . \\nthe addition of a blind man who stumbles around , falling off cliffs , walking into ledges and being a general buffoon could have had some humorous potential , but is also made terribly offensive . \\nthe only reason to see this movie is the surprise actor at the end who plays king richard . \\nhe is well worth waiting for , if you can stand an hour and half of unfunny dialogue , excruciating visual humor , old puns , ancient jokes and bad acting . \\nif you can\\'t , don\\'t even bother watching this miserable film . \\n',\n",
       "  b' \" six days , seven nights \" is a summer movie that gets the summer movie experience deliciously right , a commendable achievement considering the season thus far has been littered with some pretty uneven fare . \\nhere\\'s a genuinely fun fluff piece that knows it\\'s fluff , recognizes it\\'s fluff and is admittedly proud to be fluff . \\nof course , the casting of harrison ford in the broadly comedic lead role plays a sizeable part in the movie\\'s success ; ford is such a concentrated dramatic actor that it\\'s easy to forget what a funny guy he can be . \\nas his female counterpart , anne heche also deserves a big pat on the back for her sweet , goofily charismatic performance . \\nthe age difference ( ford\\'s 56 , heche\\'s 29 ) matters not -- these two click in a charged way that\\'s hard to come by . \\nthe story is a no-brainer -- ford stars as gruff but loveable island aviator quinn harris , while heche is career-minded but loveable new york magazine editor robin monroe . \\nrobin , on a tropical vacation with fianc ? frank ( david schwimmer ) , gets assigned to supervise an emergency photo shoot in nearby tahiti , so she reluctantly hires quinn to fly her there . \\nthe plane crashes during a terrible storm , and they immediately find themselves stuck in a deserted paradise with few ideas on getting back to civilization . \\na series of unpleasant , often hilarious catastrophes leaves little choice but for both members of this unlikely odd couple to fall for each other . \\nmeanwhile , back at the resort , frank is tempted himself by quinn\\'s shapely female tagalong ( jacqueline obradors ) . \\nthat subplot obviously exists to get us rooting for the quinn-robin pairing , and while it makes for a few good laughs early on , it eventually becomes a contrived distraction from the far more engrossing misadventures of quinn and robin . \\nand since the film spends most of its time with the castaways , this flaw is only a minor inconvenience . \\ndirector ivan reitman keeps the pace brisk . \\nat a slim 101 minutes , \" six days , seven nights \" never wears out its welcome , where a lesser film could have felt like it was as long as its title . \\nmichael browning\\'s clever screenplay allows for plenty of notable one-liners ( my favorite , taken in context , is \" you mean _arrrgh_ pirates ? \" ) , and though it essentially boils down to one mishap after another , they\\'re all quite engaging . \\neven the movie\\'s more \" serious \" moments are played with a wink . \\nheche has been under undeserved fire over whether or not her private life with ellen degeneres would affect the \" believability \" of \" six days , seven nights \" \\' heterosexual pairing . \\n ( so she\\'s a lesbian . \\nso what . \\ndeal with it . ) \\nof course it doesn\\'t , and here , her naysayers are proved wrong in a big way . \\nin fact , her chemistry with ford is what really makes the film click ; these opposites attract with the utmost , endearing electricity . \\nat one point , when the two are discussing the likelihood of romantic interest , heche asks ford how old he is . \\nafter several wrong guesses ( \" forty-five ? \\n_fifty_ ? \" ) , he whispers his age to her . \\n \" you still look good , \" heche stammers . \\n \" i still _am_ good , \" ford replies . \\nshe\\'s good too , and together , they make \" six days , seven nights \" one memorable ride . \\n',\n",
       "  b' \" gordy \" is not a movie , it is a 90-minute-long \" sesame street \" skit , and a very bad one at that . \\nthis movie is so stupid and dumb that it\\'s depressing to think that some hollywood executives actually gave this the green light , and even more surprising is the fact that this is a disney movie . \\ni\\'m sure children are the target audience of this movie , but only kids under the age of five may be able to tolerate it . \\nit is the story of a farm a piglet named gordy ( voiced by garms ) , whose family has been taken away to \" up north , \" which we know means death . \\nof course we can hear the animals talk to each other , and they actually went to the trouble of attempting to sync the voices with their mouths but it comes out terrible . \\nactually , it\\'s almost funny in a way . \\nthe only remotely interesting and likable character soon appears , a little girl named jinnie sue macallister ( young ) who sees gordy on the back of a truck and essentially steals him . \\njinnie is a country singer and the film goes off on a huge tangent to show her little concert and the people dancing to it . \\nwhat is the point of this ? \\nmaybe she is one of the producer\\'s relatives and they wanted to show her on camera to promote her or something . \\nwe then cut to a huge social gathering and drop in on another young kid named hank royce ( roescher ) who is sad because his divorced mother is dating . \\nhe leaves the party and meets jinnie sue , but he accidentally falls in a pool ( probably because he was sitting on the diving board with a $200 suit on - nah , didn\\'t see that one coming ! ) , \\nstarts to drown , and is miraculously saved as gordy pushes an inflatable float over to him and saves him . \\nif this had not been insanely stupid already the story quickly changes when jinnie gives gordy to hank who then ends up becoming the ceo of a food processing corporation when hank\\'s grandfather , the original ceo , dies and leaves his fortune to hank . . . \\nand gordy ! \\nof course there must be a villain , but even this villain ( donadio as sipes ) isn\\'t that evil . \\nhe never raises his voice or becomes angry , and of course he has the typical idiot goons kidnap gordy but this is just so beyond stupid and cartoony we are constantly two steps ahead of the story . \\nit\\'s hard to tell whether the overall corniness and cheesiness to the movie is intentional because it is a family film , or if the filmmaker\\'s are just this untalented and stupid . \\nat times \" gordy \" is tolerable to watch , thus earning it one star and not the dreaded \" z- . \" \\nbut it\\'s just so unbelievably boring , cliche , dumb , unfunny , corny , and just plain bad it may scare children , it certainly disturbed me . \\n ( 4/21/96 ) ( 1/29/97 ) ( 6/13/97 ) [see also : \" babe \" ] \\n',\n",
       "  b'saw an advanced screening of the movie sniper last night , and i have to say i wasn\\'t too impressed . \\nthis film is about an expert marine sniper , played by tom berenger , who is teamed with a hot-shot-young-no-experience-never-killed-a-man new partner to take out some drug-kingpins and military strong men in panama . \\nsound cliche ? \\nthat\\'s only the beginning . \\nbilly zane ( memphis belle ) played the rookie , and never seemed to get a handle on his character . \\nhe was so contrary and pig-headed in the beginning , you just wanted to smack him . \\nthen he goes \" crazy \" from the pressure , but seems to immediately snap out of it . \\ni\\'m not sure if the blame should lie with the directing , editing , scriptwriting , or acting . . . \\nbut it didn\\'t all come together . \\ni think berenger is a pretty good actor , and he looked great in the part , covered in camo , face painted , stalking through the jungle with his high-power rifle . . . \\nbut once again , his character was given some pretty bad dialogue , and didn\\'t react too logically to many of the situations . \\nthere was very little logical development in these characters . \\nmy biggest problem with this film was it\\'s tendency to put these two snipers in as * many * inches-from-death situations as possible . \\nthey began to resemble g . i . joes , the greatest american hero . \\nand of course their almost supernatural accuracy with their guns was called upon to get them out of far too many close calls . \\nnow a lot of movies are stamped out of this mold , in fact that\\'s what made die hard so much fun : the super-hero avenger type . \\nso some will enjoy the action hero heroics , but i didn\\'t think it fit with the nice tension that was built up in the earlier scenes , and the \" real life \" feel of covert operations in panama . \\na word must be said on the camera work , much of it was very nice . \\nthe jungles of panama ( or their stand-ins in this case ) formed a very picturesque background . . . \\nand the drama of speeding bullets was captured using some nice trick photography . \\nmany have seen the slowed down \" bullet-cam \" following the projectile to its target . \\nthis was used well in the beginning to show the feverish nightmares berenger gets when remembering the moment of the kill . \\nit was dramatic when used in flashback . . . but \\nit seems the director liked the technique so much he started inserting these shots ( pardon the pun ) into the real time action . . . then \\nit just seemed silly . \\nall in all , not a real dog : there is some nice action , good atmosphere , and pretty photography . \\nbut the plot is pretty lame , the acting didn\\'t form a cohesive whole , and far too much thisclosefromdeath heroics . \\n',\n",
       "  b\"here's a rarity : a children's film that attempts to tackle a weighty subject , is there a god ? \\ndone well , it could have been a gem among the wasteland of modern children's cinema . \\nunfortunately , it isn't . \\nwith jumbled messages , and an unclear audience , wide awake was better left asleep . \\nfifth grader joshua beal ( joseph cross ) is in the middle of a moral crisis . \\nhis beloved grandfather ( robert loggia ) has died , and joshua has begun a quest . \\nhe wants to find god , to discover why bad things happen . \\nthis religious quest is slightly disturbing for his parents ( dana delany and denis leary ) , but they do their best to cope with their son as he explores different religious faiths . \\nat his catholic school , his favorite teacher , sister terry ( rosie o'donnell ) , tries to give him guidance , but this is a journey he must make on his own . \\nmeanwhile , he is having the most momentous year of his life . \\nhe has several adventures with his daredevil best friend dave ( timothy reifsnyder ) , he gets his first crush , and begins to wake up to the world around him while he is on his spiritual journey . \\nit is somewhat confusing as to what the real audience for wide awake is expected to be . \\non its surface , it appears to be a kid's film . \\nhowever , it deals with serious issues , and is likely to be boring for today's instant-gratification kids . \\nand while it might seem heartening to see that someone is trying to produce something thoughtful for the kidvid audience , wide awake asks serious questions , but only delivers a cheap gimmick for an answer . \\nif there were a bit more meat in the story , adults on a nostalgic bent might get a kick out of the movie . \\nthe actors who might have created a great cast ( o'donnell , leary and delany ) are wasted in roles that amount to little more than cameos . \\nthe nostalgic elements ( best friend , favorite teacher , first crush , etc . ) have been done much better in other movies , and actually seem more like filler here . \\nthe film's strongest scenes are some touching flashbacks depicting joshua's relationship with his grandfather . \\nthey show more depth than is present anywhere else in the movie . \\nmaybe the film would have been better if , instead of playing the relationship through flashbacks , it were set entirely during joshua's last year with his grandpa . \\nit certainly would have been more entertaining . \\nwide awake can best be described as a failed experiment . \\nit starts out with noble aspirations , but never delivers on its promise . \\nparents who do take their children to see this one ought to be prepared to answer some tough questions . . . that is if their kids aren't bored to death first . \\n\",\n",

       "  b\"starring william baldwin ; cindy crawford & steven berkoff all right , the first problem that fair game has is the casting of supermodel cindy crawford in the lead role . \\nnot that cindy does that bad , it's just that anyone who watches this film knows from moment one that that little bit of casting was not done because of cindy's extraordinary acting skills , but for her extraordinary ability to look drop dead gorgeous in any situation . \\nand in fair game most situations tend to find cindy either soaking wet or very hot and sweaty , but i'm sure that that is just a coincidence , no doubt that these situations were essential to the plot and the fact that cindy looks great wet , well , that's just a happy coincidence . \\nsure . \\nwilliam baldwin isn't a bad actor . \\nunfortunately , he just doesn't demonstrate it at all in this movie . \\ni'm not sure if that's because most of his lines were just so hokey , or if he was trying to make cindy's acting look good . \\nif it was the latter , it worked . \\ncindy does a surprisingly good job here in her first movie . \\nwhich is not to say that she doesn't have room for improvement . \\nalthough to be fair to cindy , her lines were kinda cheesy in places . \\nso right about now you are no doubt asking yourself what sort of movie does cindy crawford , arguably the most beautiful woman on the planet , chose for her foray into the world of cinema ? \\nwell , i'm glad you asked that question . \\ncindy plays a lawyer who by some convoluted plot twists becomes a target for former elite kgb agents . \\nwhy woud they target someone as likable as cindy , you ask ? \\nby the end of the movie you won't care . \\nthe story is so contrived it isn't funny . \\nanyway after cindy gets blown out of the window of her house , without getting so much as a scratch i might add , she is placed into protective police custody under the watchful eve of william baldwin . \\nwho's character , max kilpatric , a police detective , seems to possess the skills of some sort of fighting machine ( my guess is that the writers have seen way too many of steven seagal's early films ) . \\nthe point is that the idea of the crawford and baldwin's characters of the run from these killer russians isn't all that bad of an idea , it's just everything around that basic idea which kinda stinks out loud . \\nthe supporting cast members are nothing more that over acted stereotypes . \\nif i was baldwin , i'd hope this film disappears . \\nas for crawford , she may indeed have some acting ability . \\nunfortunately , any she does have is obscured by writing that goes beyond bad . \\nthis movie was obviously written with cindy in mind , since the writers spend most of their time finding ways to capitalize off of her looks . \\nit's too bad they hadn't spent more time on a half decent plot , since ms . crawford is more than capable of looking just fine all by herself thank you very much . \\nunless you are a huge fan of either baldwin or crawford this is a movie that will only disappoint you . \\n\",\n",

       "  b'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \\nbe forewarned . \\nlike its own opening shot , from out of the darkness boogie nights triumphantly explodes upon the film scene with stunning authority and clarity , persuasively heralding its helmer paul thomas anderson as a bonafide major talent . \\na sprawling epic set in the heart of the disco era and focused upon the ascension and decline of a troupe in the adult film industry , boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride and as a strikingly impressive piece of filmmaking . \\nthe film follows a soft-spoken young man , eddie adams ( mark wahlberg ) from torrance , through his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom , and later , to a harrowingly precipitous drop . \\nas boogie nights opens , he\\'s toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy san fernando valley nightclub , and living at home under the thumb of a tyrannical mother who denigrates him at every opportunity . \\nrecruited by fatherly jack horner ( a rejuvenated burt reynolds ) , a successful porn filmmaker , eddie abandons his old life in favour of a new one as dirk diggler , pornstar . \\nwholeheartedly embraced by jack\\'s troupe , including the maternal amber waves ( julianne moore ) , reed rothchild ( john c . reilly ) , buck swope ( don cheadle ) , rollergirl ( heather graham ) , dirk and his \" one special thing \" are quickly propelled to the top of his field , fulfilling his mantra of being a \" big bright shining star \" . \\nhis lack of discipline , however , incites a chain of circumstances which sees dirk and his friends unravel as a new decade is ushered in . \\nthe element of boogie nights which literally commands attention is the bravura direction by mr . anderson , whose fascination and prowess with the camera is obvious . \\nfrom the terrific tracking shot throughout a nightclub which opens the film and introduces the players through to the showy sequence in the camera follows a female partygoer diving into a pool , mr . anderson\\'s accomplished command of the camera is without question . \\nwhile novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork which ultimately proves to be aggravating , impertinent and self-congratulatory ( case in point : marc rocco\\'s unforgettable perpetual-motion helming of murder in the first ) , in boogie nights every zoom or pan by mr . anderson , be it slow and deliberate or energetically sharp , is purposeful and potent . \\nit\\'s a rarity and a delight to discover such a confidently assured work so early in a filmmaker\\'s career -- boogie nights is only his second feature film , following up his debut feature from earlier this year , hard eight -- and although it\\'s somewhat derivative ( his storytelling style is reminiscent of robert altman , while in terms of visuals he\\'s clearly influenced by martin scorsese ) , at least he\\'s borrowing from some of the best , and it\\'s entirely effective within the context of this film . \\nwhile boogie nights is astonishingly polished from a technical perspective , in terms of sheer entertainment value it\\'s also rollicking good fun , with a wickedly deadpan sense of humour . \\nthe film perfectly captures the essence of the disco period in terms of music , clothes , hairstyles , dance , idioms , and culture , aided immeasurably by impeccable production design by bob ziembicki and costume design by mark bridges , and boogie nights convincingly catapults the audience back to this recent , pre-aids-scare period in american history where uninhibited , free-wheeling lifestyles abounded . \\nwhile much of the film\\'s humour pertains to the characters\\' obliviousness of now-outdated aspects of their lives then prevalent in society -- a prime example is part-time salesman buck swope\\'s demo of a stereo system with an eight-track tape , and inviting a prospective customer to get \\'freaky deaky\\' with the music -- it\\'s elicited with an undercurrent not of ridicule , but of wistful reminiscence , and some the throwback elements in the film are strangely wondrous . \\na giant ensemble disco dance production number in a nightclub is funny , to be sure , but oddly magical , and the sequence which lovingly explores eddie/dirk\\'s bedroom , completely adorned with posters and elements of iconic 1970s figures ( farrah fawcett , cheryl tiegs , bruce lee ) is breathtaking . \\nably supported by a well-selected collection of period music ( all of which purportedly came straight from mr . anderson\\'s personal collection ) , there\\'s a clear affection for the era in boogie nights . \\nit\\'s the period aspect and the playfully comic nostaligism of boogie nights which has been played up in its marketing campaign in deference of the pornography element of the storyline ; the film\\'s promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference to the adult film industry which unites its characters . \\nafter the debacle with 1996\\'s milos forman film , the people vs . \\nlarry flynt , another finely-crafted work which was knocked off the market prematurely due to controversy regarding its pornography-related storyline , the new line marketing team faced a unique challenge with boogie nights in terms of attempting to deemphasize the relatively risque erotic picture element of the story in order to increase salability to the general public . \\nhowever , while boogie nights delves into the world of the adult film industry of two decades ago , it\\'s hardly a lurid or seamy film -- given the subject matter , there\\'s very little nudity , and virtually none of it can be construed as gratuitous -- and boogie nights smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not as a hotbed of carnality , but simply as a business . \\nthe glimpses on the sets of jack horner\\'s shoots reveal that while the films he makes are intended to titillate , there\\'s a candid matter-of-factness in terms of sex ; his cast and crew are professionals who are merely doing a job , and it\\'s refreshing that the obvious cliches of depravity and sinful lechery often linked to dismissive portraits of adult filmmaking , such as coercion or debauchery , are avoided . \\nif anything , boogie nights is more interested in the process of adult filmmaking than the adult films themselves . \\njack horner\\'s dream is an honourable one -- he genuinely aspires to make a great film -- and to some degree boogie nights is reminiscent of ed wood ( albeit lacking a certain wistful innocence ) . \\nin both films , the world of quickie low-budget filmmaking is explored , and both jack horner and the version of ed wood by tim burton , scott alexander , and larry karaszewski share similar mindsets -- jack\\'s retort of \" there are shadows in light , baby \" to his cinematographer\\'s complaint about poor set lighting echoes back to ed wood\\'s \" it\\'s not about the little details , it\\'s about the big picture ! \" \\nrant when it is pointed out that his graveyard set for plan 9 from outer space appears patently false . \\nin boogie nights and ed wood , the aspirations of the respective filmmakers\\' prove to be bemusing , not in their intentions -- there\\'s nothing inherently silly in the goal of making an \\'artistic\\' erotic picture -- but in the degree that they miss the mark . \\nmuch like the humour lacing ed wood , the laughs involving jack horner are double-edged ; after viewing a hilarious excerpt from one of his latest films which hybridizes the james bond and porn genres , when jack breathes \" this is the best work i\\'ve ever done \" , it\\'s genuinely funny , but given his utter sincerity , also possesses a tinge of sadness . \\nmr . anderson is at this point clearly a greater talent as a director than a screenwriter . \\nwhile boogie nights shows great inventiveness in staging , there really isn\\'t any clever dialogue in the film , though a valid point certainly can be made that none of the film\\'s characters particularly lend themselves to thoughtful verbal exchanges ; when one considers that the film\\'s * protagonist * literally doesn\\'t say a single insightful thing throughout the entire 152 minute running time , it\\'s no wonder why the playfully inane \" how much can you bench ? \" \\nbanter between dirk and reed constitutes one of the film\\'s finest exchanges . \\nand while mr . anderson creates a rich collection of fascinating characters , it\\'s problematic that some of the the threads given to the film\\'s characters are simply stale material -- julianne moore\\'s child custody battle is fairly cliched stuff , better suited for a less risque and uninspired tv-movie version of her character\\'s story , and far less interesting than the thread dealing with her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions . \\nstill , even if he doesn\\'t always know what to do with his characters , mr . anderson most definitely captures their essences , and his resolutely nonjudgemental affection for them is infectious -- misguided , even aimless , hopelessly naive , self-destructive , insufferable : i loved them just the same . \\nin any case , it\\'s hard to pick nits with a screenplay which contains one of the most audacious and inspired ( and ultimately best-executed ) scenes of the year : a scene where dirk diggler and reed rothchild are dragged along by their loose-cannon compadre to the home of drug baron rahad jackson ( a mesmerizing alfred molina in an unforgettable performance , even if it\\'s a small one ) in a suicidal drug deal scam , only to find that the millionaire is a crazed eccentric ( the part where he stops the deal to listen to the crescendo of night ranger\\'s \" sister christian \" on his stereo system is sheer brilliance ) flanked by an armed bodyguard . \\nif this scene already wasn\\'t tense enough with these elements , mr . anderson introduces a chinese boy that wanders through the scene , who for no discernable reason is tossing firecrackers around the room , pushing the scene to a new , surreal level of delightful giddiness . \\nthere are some other interesting touches in boogie nights . \\nmr . anderson recycles the use of long methodical chimes on the soundtrack from hard eight ; here , it accompanies the violent intercut sequences which depict the prostration of various characters to frightening effect . \\nsimilarly , a painful scene where crew member scotty j ( philip seymour hoffman ) breaks down in tears in the driver\\'s seat , sobbing \" i\\'m so stupid \" after being rebuffed by dirk after an awkward but heartfelt advance is strikingly played out exactly as a later scene with dirk in the driver\\'s seat after a particularly tumultuous and traumatic evening . \\nboogie nights is exceedingly well cast , and each of the actors rise to the occasion ; the ensemble cast is uniformly good . \\nwhile most of the acting accolades will no doubt go to mr . wahlberg ( fulfilling upon the sparks of promise he demonstrated in some of his earlier films ) and mr . reynolds ( terrific as the father figure and stable anchor of the film , ringing true in every respect ) , a handful of other performances which might otherwise be overlooked deem mention . \\nmr . reilly demonstrates here , as he did for brief glimpses in ulu grosbard\\'s georgia , a genuine aptitude for comedy -- many of his scenes in boogie nights are among the very funniest in the film . \\ni\\'m not sure how much of his performance as reed was scripted and how much was done on the spot , but he plays the quintessential second banana character to a tee . \\nmr . reilly is the best part of the big disco dance production number , and it\\'s wickedly funny to watch his reed join in with dirk after the fact in threatening the new stud on the block during a macho altercation . \\nworth the price of admission alone is the glimpse of him getting down in the recording studio while the dirk character is laying down a numbingly bad ( and dead-on period ; it sure sounds like bad early 1980s to me ) demo track \" you got the touch \" in a vain attempt at a musical career . \\nmr . reilly plays his vacant character with utter conviction which is convincing and effective . \\nms . graham , with her long dirty blonde hair , innocent demeanour , and huge hazel eyes , looks like a disney animated heroine come to life -- or in this case , a disney animated heroine who came to life , made a wrong turn , and ended up on the new line lot in a film focused on the late 70s / early 80s adult film industry . \\nconsequently , it\\'s a bit incongruous to see this cheery sweet-faced starlet whizzing about the set on her roller skates , but in a scene where she\\'s lounging in a limousine prowling the streets , garish red lipstick messily smeared on , giving the camera a hilariously pouty come-hither look , all one can do is gulp . \\nher role in the film sadly needs more fleshing out ( err -- in a figurative sense ) -- she\\'s essentially a glorified extra -- but she does score impressively in her key scene which is unnerving in its sheer primal ferocity . \\n ( if only mr . anderson had filmed the scene so that we could actually see the expression of rage and anguish on her face , though ! ) \\nand a cautionary tale for the strict and prudish : as a teen , ms . graham\\'s parents forbade her to take a part in the twisted cult classic heathers ; since then , her most notable roles have been as a junkie ( gus van sant\\'s drugstore cowboy ) and now a porn starlet . \\ndraw your own conclusions . \\nperhaps the most quietly touching performance in boogie nights is that of mr . cheadle , who lends dignity to his role as a character in search of his identity , and whose quest is comically manifested by a series of changes in his sense of fashion . \\nhis relationship with his cheerfully supportive new wife jessie st . vincent ( an interesting melora walters ) is wholly compelling has genuine sweetness , and although his general longing for acceptance from others is perceptible , it\\'s no more so than in the bank scene where his loan application to open a stereo store is rejected due to his background in the porn industry . \\nwhile the scenario is familiar , the wounded look in cheadle\\'s eyes makes the scene unforgettable . \\nluis guzman\\'s most famous work is possibly in brian de palma\\'s carlito\\'s way , and here he plays a variation on the same character : maurice t . rodriguez is a hapless but good-natured nightclub owner who\\'s a hanger-on to jack\\'s group , ingratiating himself into the clique and constantly hounding jack , with little disguise made of his desperation , for a part in one of his erotic pictures . \\njack\\'s eventual acquiescence to maurice\\'s request leads to one of boogie nights\\' biggest comic payoffs . \\nboogie nights is a stunning achievement due to the virtuoso direction by mr . anderson , who immediately asserts his presence in the film industry as a presence of note with this work . \\nstriking a fine balance between humour and drama , and exceptionally well-crafted , there\\'s no doubt that boogie nights is among the very best films of the year . \\n',\n",

       "  b'shakespeare in love is quite possibly the most enjoyable period piece ever made for the silver screen . \\nit is both humorous and romantic in a very unique blend that can successfully entertain any audience for the nearly 2 and and a half hours that it occupies . \\nthat is , however , not to say it is a good film , a quality production or anything of the sort . \\nshakespeare in love is an incredibly cheap illusion that truly pans out to be very little quality or original work . \\nthe finest sign of this may be the plot , in looking back , there seems to be little more than a thin , predictable plot that is only carried by the portrayal of people that we revere in our history books . \\nphilip henslowe ( geoffrey rush ) owns 1 of the 2 theatres in london . \\nit is at the peak of the royal theatre era , and queen elizabeth ( the recently damed judi dench , by , appropriately enough , queen elizabeth ii ) is very much a fan . \\nhowever , to directly quote the film , he has \" cash flow problems . \" \\nthrough a long set of events , it becomes apparent that his entire life is dependent on his next show doing well enough to pay off his debts . \\nso , mr . henslowe employs the young playwright , william shakespeare ( joseph fiennes ) to pen a comedic production . \\nhowever , the young writer has a severe case of writer\\'s block , and blames it on the fact that his love life is struggling as well . \\nhe has the title in mind , romeo and ethel , the pirate\\'s daughter ( even that joke loses steam after a while ) but can\\'t seem to put words to paper . \\nthen , as only hollywood could have it , through a long set of twisted events , he meets viola de lesseps ( gwyneth paltrow ) and falls madly in love , thus curing his writer\\'s block . \\nthere are many other little issues that mr . henslowe encounters , but they all pan out to be much ado about nothing . \\nthe first realization that i reached in watching this film is that one of the messages given is that a show should not always be credited to it\\'s author . \\nironically , that couldn\\'t be truer here . \\nthe great scenes that will sweep audiences away are not the scenes that fit in the plot , but rather the recitals of shakespearean lines by actors playing actors . \\none of the most breathtaking moments in this film does not involve the character of shakespeare or queen elizabeth or even the theatre owner , but rather 2 young children named romeo and juliet who chose to end their own lives in the name of love . \\nso it is that i am offended by the fact that marc norman and tom stoppard are credited with writing this production , and the name william shakespeare is no were to be seen beyond a character\\'s name in the credits . \\nthe acting in this entertaining yet poor film is often thin to the point that it would not have survived even in queen elizabeth\\'s theatres . \\njoseph fiennes may just be the worst of fall though . \\nhe is tragically unbelievable and comically bad . \\ngwyneth paltrow is little more than satisfactory in her lead position as well . \\nhowever , the supporting cast does almost save the day . \\ngeoffrey rush is nothing short of incredible and judi dench is breathtaking . \\nthey both seem to have shown that as proven actors they could survive in this film of weak links . \\nyou will also find a very good performance by ben affleck in his first real role since good will hunting ( no , armageddon doesn\\'t qualify as real acting . ) . \\nand rupert everett was cute in his small part as well . \\nbut not even they could save this sad excuse for a film , so it remains plagued by poor performances . \\nwhen all is said and done , shakespeare in love is only worth the trip if you want to be entertained . \\nhowever , as the film so kindly pointed out , entertainment may be fun , but it isn\\'t necessarily quality . \\nand this certainly isn\\'t quality . \\nperhaps this may be best compared to a john grisham novel , as a dear friend of mine often does compare things to his work . \\nsimply put , it is far-fetched , poorly crafted , but very entertaining . \\n',\n",

       "  b\"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \\nbe forewarned . \\nmilos forman's first film since the ill-fated valmont , columbia's the people vs . \\nlarry flynt , is a vastly entertaining ( if not particularly enlightening ) biopic of hustler publisher and self-made millionaire larry flynt , who became an unlikely champion of freedom of speech rights in the united states in the late 1970s and early 1980s . \\nthe film unweaves its tale in a chronological order : we open with young and dirt-poor larry flynt and his brother jimmy , peddling jars of water in true entrepreneurial spirit out in the rural outback of kentucky . \\ncut to forward in time , where the two flynt brothers , now young men , are running the struggling hustler go-go clubs in cincinnati . \\nthe strip clubs are in a dire financial state , and in a last-ditch effort to salvage the operations , flynt decides to go to a print shop and churn out a promotional newsletter . \\nthis evolved into the adult periodical _hustler_ magazine , creating larry flynt a vast financial empire , and the rest is history . \\nwhat sets flynt apart from other publishers is his struggles against those who would have him cease publication of his adult material , and who railed and preached against him - flynt spent time in incarceration and was paralyzed by an assassination attempt - and his driven , single-minded insistence to buck the system and fight for his freedom of expression , regardless of personal cost . \\nthe people vs . \\nlarry flynt also weaves in the bittersweet story of flynt's true love , althea leasure , whom he meets as a dancer in his club and later marries , and who devotedly stands alongside him throughout his trials and tribulations . \\nconsidering the serious nature of the film's theme - the importance of the united states' first amendment - the people vs . \\nlarry flynt is surprisingly and wonderfully light-hearted and humourous . \\nmuch of the comedy is elicited from larry flynt's outlandish stunts at his courtroom appearances - some of his chosen apparel is hilarious - and for the most part these elements of the film work far better than some of the more dramatic points , such as an uninspiring flynt monologue set at a free speech rally in front of an enormous american flag dealing with the subjectivity of obscenity . \\nthe film's focus is on the flynt's many battles over first amendment rights and freedom of speech , but the heart of the people vs . \\nlarry flynt is the touching love story between flynt and althea . \\nlarry flynt is shown as being occassionally gruff , harsh , and overtly aggressive with his friends and colleagues , but with althea , we see his loving , affectionate side . \\nthere's a scene where flynt tenderly takes his ill wife on a ride on his wheelchair that is heartbreaking . \\nultimately , the emotional power that the film hits at its conclusion comes not from his achievements from his battles against censors , but from the strength of flynt and althea's love for each other . \\nwoody harrelson is entirely engaging in what must be certainly a career-topping performance as the irrepressible larry flynt . \\nharrelson plays flynt with the right mixture of outrageousness and confident stubborness to make him endearing and entirely sympathetic to the audience , and a very compelling protagonist for the film . \\ncourtney love plays althea leasure in a startling turn , completely raw and impulsive . \\nit's a very solid performance , brash and naturalistic , and love is extremely compelling ; it's difficult to take your eyes off her onscreen , and her chemistry with harrelson is dead-on . \\nedward norton , as flynt's straight , level-headed lawyer is often upstaged by his flashier co-stars in the people vs . \\nlarry flynt , much as his counterpart lawyer alan isaacman was upstaged by flynt during many of the courtroom scenes , but norton shines in his big scene where he addresses the supreme court in the climactic scene of the film . \\none can sense the frustration that norton's character feels when harrelson's free-talking flynt sabotages trial after trial on him by openly speaking his mind , and this results in a heightened emotional punch when norton's isaacman has the opportunity to sway the supreme court judges . \\nmilos forman keeps the film moving - although it runs over two hours , it never drags - and his direction of the film is very effective , eliciting a great deal of empathy for a subject which could be construed by some as extremely sordid and unsympathetic . \\nthere's also a great visual technique which forman uses to indicate the passing of time in one shot , which is both clever and extremely entertaining . \\ntwo minor quibbles with the film - it certainly seems like the people vs . \\nlarry flynt is in a rush to get to its main theme , with flynt battling against authorities and the system for his freedom of speech . \\nconsequently , the first thirty minutes of the film , introducing and setting up the characters , seem unduly rushed ; perhaps it is merely due to the fact that these characters are so interesting , but i felt it would have worked better if this route was taken in a more leisurely fashion . \\nit also felt like there was a distinctive lack of insight into the inner workings of these characters - the film clearly shows what flynt , althea , isaacman , and rev . jerry faldwell did , and on a superficial level some of their motivations , but it never seemed like one could really understand the characters on a deeper level . \\nfor example , why larry flynt was compelled by ruth carter stapleton ( president carter's sister ) to be born-again is a mystery to me . \\nthen again , perhaps it was to him as well . \\nthese two points don't detract greatly from the film . \\nthe people vs . \\nlarry flynt is certainly among the very best studio-released films of 1996 , and works both as a ringing political statement about the importance of freedom of speech and the depths to which larry flynt would go to advance the cause of free expression , and as a touching love story . \\n\",\n",
       "  b\"arriving in a barrage of hype , the blair witch project is one of the biggest box office success of the year . \\nhowever , like the golden child , although blair witch has made a lot of money , it's not very good . \\ndonahue , williams and leonard play themselves as three students who set out to make a documentary about the blair witch myth . \\nthe film is made up of the camcorder footage they recorded , which means grainy footage and woozy camera angles . \\nalthough events start of normal , they get weird pretty quickly , while the threesome argue more and more as the journey goes on . \\nalthough an interesting premise , the blair witch project amounts to nothing more than a missed opportunity . \\nthe biggest mistake the film makes is to let three mediocre actors the chance to improvise . \\nmost of the dialogue is ad-libbed , and still manages to sound like a poor b-movie . \\nthe 'script' eventually degenerates into shouting matches , with the f-word included a lot to sound like students . \\nthere are breaks in these arguments where some creepy events occur , but then it's back to the shouting and swearing , which gets very tiresome very quickly . \\nif i wanted to see three people get lost in the woods , shout a lot and swear , i'd go on scout camp . \\nbut no , the audience is meant to get some entertainment factor out of this , but i'm not quite sure how . \\nthe supernatural parts of the film are actually interesting , especially if close attention is paid to the story developing first twenty minutes . \\nwith no music and no budget to work with , the film has to depend on natural , psychological scares , which are sometimes well delivered , sometimes not . \\ni never really felt truly scared during any part of the film , although there is a small sense of fear underlying throughout the film . \\nhowever , because the actors are so irritating , the scares are lost when it eventually reverts back to heather saying 'what the f * ck is that ? ' \\na lot , and mike giggling like a loony . \\nthere's also the niggling fact that these student filmmakers do some really stupid things . \\nthe main problem is the fact that even though these hapless bunch could be killed at any moment , and are hopelessly lost , heather still insists on filming it all . \\nthe film gives a half hearted reason why she should want to do this , but it isn't very convincing . \\nalso , the students have no idea how to survive in the woods , such as following a large river flowing through the woods to civilisation . \\nthere are also some parts where the 'amateur' camcorder footage is obviously staged , heather's apology being a major one . \\nthe blair witch project , in the end , just fails to deliver . \\ni suppose if you've been lost camping before , the film may deliver some chills , but this is no use for the other 99% of the paying audience who haven't been lost in the woods . \\napart from the final minutes , the film is mind boggingly unscary , and the shouting matches get hideously dull . \\nthe spook scenes are short and far between , and any other horror movie could probably achieve the same amount of fear that these scenes provide . \\nalthough a good idea , it's not executed well enough to be a fun , scary cinema experience . \\nit's a worrying fact when the website ( http : //www . blairwitch . com \\n ) is better than the film . \\n\",\n",

       "  b\"i suppose it's unfair to criticize a movie like hudson hawk , which has been panned by reviewers and moviegoers alike since it's 1991 release . \\nmichael lehmann's action-comedy was quick to win the title `biggest box office flop of all time' , or close thereof . \\nthe movie stars bruce willis as renowned cat burglar hudson hawk , who's just been released from sing sing prison after many years in isolation ( `let me put it this way , ' he explains , `i never saw et' ) . \\ngreeting him is his old friend and partner in crime ( played by danny aiello ) , who becomes the subject of many amusing fat jokes . \\nthese are rather welcome in a movie filled with so many completely unfunny sight gags , cartoonish villains and unbelievable coincidences . \\nit appears as if director lehmann didn't know when to stop all the absurd silliness , and he piles on layer after layer of utter ridiculousness as the movie propels itself toward the finish line . \\nif at some point during hudson hawk you make the assumption that things couldn't get goofier , you'll soon be eating your words . \\nbut , i'm inclined to say that this film is not quite as terrible as it's box office numbers suggest . \\nit's fast-paced and entertaining , if you've got incredible patience and a warped sense of humor . \\nfor the first portion of this review , i'm going to try and center on the positive aspects of hudson hawk . \\nwish me luck . \\nfirst and foremost : bruce willis is a good sport . \\nwhile i'm not entirely sure what he was smoking when he co-wrote this script , willis is quite aware that the entire project is a big , fat , ugly joke . \\nhe constantly gives deadpan reactions to things that are very silly and out-of-place , which means he has more than his share of deadpan reactions . \\nanother plus is the appearance of andie macdowell as a schizophrenic nun and love interest for the title character . \\nthey meet when hudson goes on a mission to steal a priceless book from the vatican , and their relationship escalates in interest from there . \\nit's unfortunate that mcdowell's one-note character is used just as an excuse for there to be a predictable plot-twist , and she offers absolutely no encouraging chemistry with willis . \\nbut now i'm rambling on again about the negative things , aren't i ? \\nenough of the charade - for the most part , hudson hawk is an excruciating experience . \\nit's stupid , pointless and repetitive . \\ni can only wonder what bruce willis fans thought after exiting the theater , because this film really doesn't have the potential to please anyone . \\naction fans should take note that hudson hawk is composed of 90% comedy , and even the action sequences are skittery , rushed and poorly edited . \\nand those expecting a hearty laugh or two will find it difficult even to smirk during all of the headache-inducing hi-jinks . \\ndon't get me wrong , this film is not devoid of laughs . \\nit's too bad most of them are unintentional , or just plain forced . \\nthe impressive cast looks suitably embarrassed . \\nit's understandable to see willis and aiello in a movie of this caliber , but as for the presence of future academy award winner james coburn i'm not entirely sure . \\ncoburn plays a former nemesis of the hawk who again comes into play , and he looks unsure of his place the entire movie . \\nespecially when he resorts to martial arts during the final showdown , and has a fight with willis that would look right at home in a jackie chan film . \\nthings get more bizarre when we're introduced to his team of rejects named after chocolate bars , including future nypd blue star david caruso as the speechless , card-flipping kit-kat . \\nif that's not enough for you , there's richard e . grant and sandra bernhard hamming it up as a deranged couple on the brink of a convoluted economic takeover . \\ntheir crotch-biting pooch provides a couple of the big laughs here . \\nwait , maybe the only big laughs . . . \\ni'm not sure what kind of movie everyone had in mind when filming hudson hawk . \\ni can't even begin to start about the film's absurd plot ; but let's not get into that . \\ni suppose there's some amusement viewers could derive from the ridiculous premise , if they were that desperate . \\nbut hudson hawk never even has a clue of where it's going from minute one , and from there it's 90 minutes of pure cinematic muck . \\n\",\n",

       "  b'it\\'s time to take cover . \\nafter a hiatus of about fifteen years , the disaster movie has come back with renewed zest . \\nin early 1997 , there were no less than three movies about volcanoes alone , one on television and two in the theaters , with dante\\'s peak and volcano in heavy competition for the moviegoing dollar . \\nof the two , i had heard that dante\\'s peak was the better film , so i decided to check it out when it was released on video . \\nthe film begins with a slow motion scene of people in a third world country trying to evacuate their little town . \\nthe town is being covered in ash and sulfuric water from what we presume is a volcanic eruption . \\nflaming rocks of various sizes also fall from the sky , crushing homes and people . \\nwe see people panicking , people crying , and even horses rearing . \\nit is a disaster of biblical proportions , signified to us by one person dragging a cross down a road . \\nsymbolism doesn\\'t get much more blatant than that . \\nwe learn that harry dalton ( pierce brosnan ) , a volcanologist with the u . s . geological survey , was there with his wife when the eruption occurred . \\nharry survived , but his wife did not . \\na few years later , harry is sent to investigate some unusual seismic activity detected near the small town of dante\\'s peak , washington ( which , we are told , has been voted second most desirable place to live ( under 20 , 000 ) by the readers of money magazine ) . \\nthere harry meets rachel wando , a single mother of two who serves as mayor of dante\\'s peak and proprietor of a small coffee shop . \\nalthough the mayor doesn\\'t seem to be alarmed by the presence of a man sent to determine if the mountain next to their town is going to blow up , a few members of the city council are . \\nthey are afraid that harry\\'s presence is going to scare off an investor who has pledged to put millions of dollars into developing dante\\'s peak . \\nthey would rather have any news of possible stirrings within the neighboring dormant volcano swept under the rug . \\nhowever , when an amorous young couple takes a skinny-dip in the local hot springs , they turn up cooked by lava which bubbles up from a small fissure underneath . \\nthus begins a chain of events leading up to the inevitable eruption . \\nthis film contains a number of cliches . \\nthe amorous couple is one . \\nas soon as they doff their clothes , you know they\\'re going to die . \\nthe town busybody and the abrasive mother-in-law make appearances , as does the death-defying dog . \\ncountless familiar scenarios only serve to make this film very predictable . \\nwatching the movie , i was able to not only anticipate each of the major plot elements , but some of the dialogue as well . \\nunfortunate , since much of the dialog is terrible . \\nfor example , harry\\'s boss , paul ( charles hallahan ) , and a team from the u . s . geological survey join harry to assess the situation . \\npaul basically tells the townsfolk that harry\\'s eruption predictions aren\\'t cause for alarm . \\nthis causes harry to leave in a fit of rage , only to turn up the next day , ready for work . \\nwhen paul asks harry why he stayed , he says with grim determination , \" cause this town\\'s in trouble and i\\'m the best man you\\'ve got . \" \\neven better is when harry is trying to explain the need to jolt the residents into leaving . \\nhe likens the situation to how a frog will jump out if dropped into a pot of boiling water . \\nif the frog is in cold water which is gradually heated up , however , the frog won\\'t move and will allow itself to be cooked . \\n \" is that your recipe for frog soup ? \" \\nasks one of the team members . \\n \" it\\'s my recipe for disaster , \" responds harry . \\ndante\\'s peak has a singular talent for pointing out the obvious . \\nour heroes are in a boat in the middle of a lake which harry realizes the volcanic activity has turned to acid . \\nmayor wando demonstrates her brilliant powers of deduction by proclaiming , in a very grave tone , \" acid eats metal . \" \\nthanks for the tip . \\nwhen we first see the u . s . geological survey building , there\\'s a caption labeling it as such . \\nthis wouldn\\'t have been so bad if it weren\\'t for the fact that the caption is right above a sign on the building which reads , in large letters , \" u . s . geological survey . \" \\ni suppose the caption is for people who can\\'t read signs . \\nalthough harry and mayor wando become an item by the end of the film , the viewer has no idea why . \\nthere is a severe lack of chemistry between the two characters , and the relationship seems rushed because of this . \\nwhen they get close to kissing , i was asking myself , \" why do they want to kiss ? \\nwere they even attracted to each other ? \" \\nif i were the mayor , i would sure think twice about kissing a guy who doesn\\'t even crack a smile through the whole movie , trying to pull off the rough-yet-debonair act . \\nwho does he think he is ? \\njames bond ? \\nthe eruption of the volcano feels similarly rushed . \\nthere are several \" warning signs \" prior to the eruption itself , but they are so lackluster and without suspense that we don\\'t feel as if they are leading up to anything . \\nfor example , one of the survey team members makes his way down into the crater of the volcano in order to retrieve a remote controlled robot . \\na tremor occurs . \\ndoes he plunge headlong to his death ? \\nis he engulfed in lava which shoots up from below ? \\nno , a couple of rocks fall on him and break his leg . \\nthe sole purpose of this scene seemed to be to set up the subsequent chopper rescue scene , which i suppose was intended to be dramatic as well . \\nit wasn\\'t . \\none plot thread left noticeably hanging was the investment in the town of dante\\'s peak . \\nin a disaster movie , there\\'s usually one guy who\\'s greedy enough to cover up the possibility of eruption/fire/earthquake/explosion/tsunami/tornado/meteorite , and usually gets killed by the disaster . \\nit\\'s okay , of course , because we all think he got what he deserved . \\nif you\\'re going to be unoriginal , you might as well go all the way . \\nin dante\\'s peak , the city councilmembers are concerned , but they don\\'t really try hard enough . \\nmaybe the mayor\\'s abrasive mother-in-law should have been the one . \\nfor no apparent reason , she snaps at harry for even positing that the volcano could erupt . \\nperhaps her ancestors invested in some pompeii real estate . \\nthere are a couple of good things about this movie . \\nthe first is the scenery . \\nthere are panoramic shots of forests , lakes and mountains that are absolutely beautiful . \\nthe second is the special effects . \\nthey are the closest i\\'ve ever seen to a real pyroclastic eruption . \\nbut when elements which don\\'t speak are going to be the best parts of your movie , you\\'d probably better rewrite the script . \\n',\n",
       "  b'what\\'s shocking about \" carlito\\'s way \" is how good it is . \\nhaving gotten a bit of a bad rap for not being a big box office hit like pacino\\'s previous film , \" scent of a woman , \" and not having as strong a performance as he did in that one ( he had just won an oscar ) , \" carlito\\'s way \" was destined for underrated heaven . \\nthat\\'s what it is : an underrated gem of a movie . \\nand what a shame because pacino and de palma both do amazing jobs with it , and turn it into a great piece of a pulpy character study . \\n \" carlito\\'s way \" deals with , well , carlito brigante ( pacino ) , a puerto rican ex-drug kingpin , who gets out of a long jailterm when his coke-addicted , curly-haired lawyer ( sean penn ) points out a legal technicality . \\nof course , carlito was actually awoken in prison , and has decided to go straight , even if he\\'s really a crook at heart . \\ncarlito , like barry lyndon , is a man who is trapped by fate at every turn , and can\\'t escape into something he is not . \\ncarlito\\'s attempts at a clean , legal life are thwarted at nearly every turn . \\nwhen he first gets out , a friend of his ends up leading him into a big shoot-out , where he has to kill a couple people to survive . \\nhe\\'s constantly getting bugged by the government to see if he\\'s doing anything illegal , and his lawyer finds himself neck-deep in a pile of shit , needing him to try and help him out , which includes him doing some prison breaking . \\ncarlito , like ratso rizzo , wants to go to miami ( since , according to film logic , that\\'s where it\\'s at ) , but needs some funding . \\nbeing a legend , he is quickly able to get a nice job running a big dance club ( this is the 70s , by the way , and since some of this takes place in night clubs , we get to hear all sorts of 70s classics , including several k . c . \\nand the sunshine band tunes - my personal favorite ) . \\nhe gets a bodyguard ( the great luis guzman , at his best ) , and is soon running a pretty good business , even if he\\'s constantly attracting underworld young thugs , like benny blanco \" from the bronx \" ( john leguiziamo ) , who is more than once pointed out to be a young version of carlito . \\non the other side , the symbol of promise and hope , is gail ( penelope ann miller - what happened to her ? ) , his girlfriend from before prison . \\nshe\\'s a goregeous ballerina , and a stripper , and soon carlito is trying to get back with her , and take her with him when he finally leaves for miami . \\nwhile this relationship is never fully defined or anything , we get a sense of love between them , and they have some truly interesting scenes between them ( she never gives him addresses or locales - he always has to track her down ) . \\nall of these elements clash together at the end , in a brilliantly executed , emotional climax , which is inevitable . \\nwhen i say inevitable , i mean we see it at the beginning and then backtrack , putting a great spin on it . \\nsure , it\\'s going to eleveate some of the tension , but it gives the film a lot of depth , as carlito is seen trapped by fate . \\nwhat\\'s amazing is the big chase sequence ( amazingly done by de palma ) has a lot of tension and thrills . \\nlike \" apollo 13 , \" we know what\\'s going to happen , but we\\'re still thrilled by what happens in the middle . \\nit\\'s also very emotional , thanks to a great script by david koepp , and amazing performances by pacino and miller . \\nde palma is famous ( or infamous ) for lots of violence in his films . \\nhis earlier flim , \" scarface \" ( which starred pacino in the lead ) , has a ton of it , especially at the end ( and a nasty chainsaw scene towards the beginning which i\\'m still not over ) . \\nbut de palma actually reigns in more quieter scenes . \\nto me , the best scene in the film is when carlito is on top of a building , looking down into the room where gail is doing ballet . \\nthis is the most brilliantly done , and most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire film , and probably the best in de palma film history . \\nwith a gorgeous soprano duet in the background , and rain pouring down onto a trashcan lid covering carlito\\'s head , and a saddened , remorseful look on pacino\\'s face , it\\'s a tear-jerker ( well , for me , i dunno about you . . . ) . \\nthe acting from all is great , especially from the three leads . \\npacino was panned for his performance , chiefly because his accent wasn\\'t puerto rican enough and , well , it wasn\\'t as \" strong \" as his oscar-winning role in \" scent of a woman . \" \\nwell , his \" scent of a woman \" performance was great and all , but it was nothing really but , as comic kevin pollack said , a \" foghorn leghorn impression . \" \\nin \" carlito\\'s way , \" he\\'s emotional , and strong , despite the fact that he\\'s remorseful over his entire lifestyle , which he cannot change . \\ni felt more for carlito brigante than i did for the tango-dancing , insult-throwing blind guy in \" scent of a woman . \" \\nas i said , penelope ann miller is great , and she and pacino actually have very good chemistry . \\nand they\\'re scenes are well-written , with some good clever dialogue which adds some interest to an otherwise bland relationship . \\nand sean penn is amazing as the coke-addicted rat attorney . \\nevery scene he\\'s in , he has great energy , and even measures up to the greatness that is pacino . \\nin smaller roles , john leguiziamo and luis guzman are great . \\n \" carlito\\'s way \" is one of those films which you heard about briefly , but when you finally watch it , you\\'re absolutely blown away . \\nit\\'s a wonderful film , a highly underrated little masterpiece which was shelved after it didn\\'t do so hot . \\nbut trust me and check it out . \\nit\\'s a great little film , and proof that the residential critics and mass populus are not always right . \\n',\n",
       "  b'first , i am not a big fan of the x-files tv series . \\ni have nothing against it particularly , i just don\\'t happen to watch it . \\nhaving said that , i can now say that i liked the x-files pretty well . \\nfor us non-fans , there\\'s nothing big going for it , but there are a lot of little things . \\nthe movie opens on an ice cave in north texas in 35 , 000 b . c . \\ntwo proto-humans enter the cave and find a space alien cocooned inside . \\nthe alien breaks free and kills one man in a struggle while the other is seemingly captured by the bloody ooze from the alien . \\nthe movie jumps to the same cave today where a boy ( lucas black , from sling blade ) is captured by the same black ooze . \\nwe then cut to fbi agents scully and mulder ( gillian anderson and david duchovny ) , who have been pulled off of their previous assignment ( investigations into the paranormal ) and put onto the bomb squad detail . \\na caller has threatened a federal building in dallas , texas . \\non a hunch , mulder checks out the building across the street , and , wouldn\\'t you know it , he turns out to be right . \\nthe fbi finds the bomb in time to evacuate but not in time to defuse . \\nfive people die in the blast , and when mulder learns who the victims were , a light bulb goes on over his head . \\nthe two agents team up to investigate , against fbi orders , the links mulder has made . \\ntheir search leads them back to the north texas cave , all across the country , and even to antarctica as they get closer and closer to \" the truth . \" \\nthe plot , and \" the truth , \" are uninspired . \\ni got the feeling that what i learned was supposed to shock and amaze me . \\nit didn\\'t . \\nthe possible existence of aliens on earth has been explored so many times before in movies that one could hardly count them . \\nbut the point of the x-files is not what the truth is , but the extent to which it has been hidden . \\nit\\'s a slightly more interesting angle , but it still raises expectations about that \" truth \" too high . \\nif this were the whole film , i would say the movie was mediocre , perhaps even boring . \\nbut there are other qualities that make me like this movie well enough to recommend it . \\nthe pacing of the film was brisk enough to hold my interest . \\nbefore the audience can get tired of one location , the agents follow a hot tip to another location , and so on and so forth . \\nthe locations are not all computer-generated sets , either . \\nthere are some artificial settings , but the desert night of nevada , the edge of suburbia in texas , and the endless fields of snow in antarctica ( actually somewhere in north america . ) \\nmake this fantastic film feel more real . \\nward russell\\'s cinematography is very good . \\nthe overall look is dark and ominous , appropriate to the intended tone of the film\\'s plot . \\nrussell is able to make something as innocuous as a cornfield look foreboding . \\nwhen the movie is set in darkness , the picture quality is still rich and detailed . \\nfinally , and specifically , there is an incredible shot at night in which the camera crosses the tracks in front of a fast oncoming train . \\ni don\\'t know if the shot is faked in any way , but it looks dangerous , and it looks great . \\nthe movie\\'s soundtrack is also used to convey the dark tone of the film . ( skip \\nto the next paragraph if you have yet to see the movie - there is a spoiler in the following sentences . ) during the opening prehistoric sequence , a howling wind dogs the soundtrack , never giving the characters or the audience an escape from the lonely terrible sound . \\nin one of the movie\\'s most effective sequences , metallic doors suddenly slam open to release a cloud of buzzing bees . \\nthe visuals of the scene are good , but what makes it so surprising and frightening is the sound . \\nthere was no question as to who the movie\\'s stars would be . \\neven so , duchovny and anderson are an interesting pair of actors and a good combination . \\nboth are easy on the eyes and together , they have some good timing , banter , and energy . \\nthere is a hint of chemistry between them , but it never gets in the way of their professional relationship . \\nthey are like a couple of kids out exploring the empty lot at the end of the street . \\nthere might be some romantic interest , but for now they\\'re more interested in their environs than they are in each other . \\nno single element really makes this movie outstanding - not even the sense of paranoia that makes the tv show so popular . \\nbut enough things were done right that the x-files is one of the more interesting summer adventures to come along . \\n',\n",

       "  b'more than forty years ago , the \" sword and sandals \" genre of historical epic ruled the box office . \\nduring the 1950\\'s hollywood sought to give audiences a reason to turn off their televisions and go out to the movies by offering the grand spectacle of the roman empire in cinemascope . \\n \" ben-hur . \" \\n \" cleopatra . \" \\n \" the robe . \" \\n \" sparticus . \" \\n \" the fall of the roman empire . \" \\n \" quo vadis . \" \\nsometimes brilliant , sometimes campy , the roman epic was the technicolor funeral pyre of classic hollywood . \\nsince then , epics have appeared infrequently ( \" the last emperor , \" \" braveheart \" ) and some of the best have been small-screen affairs produced in the 1970\\'s ( \" roots , \" \" shogun \" ) . \\nyet , the phrase \" we who are about to die salute you \" has been absent until now . \\n \" gladiator \" begins in germania in a . d . 180 . \\nroman general maximus ( russell crowe ) has conquered yet another group of barbarians for his emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) , and he is eager to retire to his plantation in spain where his wife and son are waiting . \\nhowever , the emperor is worried that his decadent weakling son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) will prove a poor successor , so he wants to make maximus his heir as a transition toward rome becoming a republic again . \\nwhen commodus hears the plan , he strangles his father and orders maximus and his family murdered . \\nmaximus escapes from the executioners , but he arrives home too late to save his wife and son . \\na caravan of slavers pick up the wounded hero and carry him off to north africa . \\n ( why the caravan happened to be cruising by maximus\\' place is never explained . ) \\nan african named juba ( djimon hounsou ) treats maximus\\' wounds . \\nproximo ( oliver reed ) , a gladiator who won his freedom , purchases maximus and juba as fodder for the arena . \\nof course , maximus proves as able a gladiator as he was a soldier , and his fame spreads . \\nwhen commodus reopens the coliseum , proximo brings his troupe of warriors to rome to compete . \\nour hero wins the hearts and minds of the cheering crowds and finds that he has an ally in commodus\\' sister lucilla ( connie nielsen ) . \\nthe similarities to \" braveheart \" are obvious : an evil king , a determined warrior seeking revenge for his murdered family , the aid of a lovestruck princess . \\nalso , like mel gibson\\'s epic , \" gladiator \" has a primarily visceral appeal and is driven forward by the hero\\'s anger . \\nit\\'s a simple tale of good versus evil . \\nmaximus has all the manly virtues : nobility of purpose , courage in battle , loyalty to king and country , physical stamina , and devotion to family . \\ncommodus is his opposite in every way : a sniveling , selfish coward who is intended to disgust the audience . \\nthe opening night crowd in my theater was about 70% male , and that seems appropriate . \\n \" gladiator \" is a guy movie ( would the opposite of a \" chick flick \" be a \" dick flick \" ? ) . \\nthere\\'s much pumping of testosterone and chopping off of body parts in gruesome battle sequences . \\n ( those easily offended by gore should stay away . ) \\nlucilla is the only female character , and what sparks there are between her and maximus are dampened by his devotion to his dead wife . \\njoaquin phoenix gives an astounding performance . \\nin the scene where commodus kills his father , phoenix shows the pain of a son who has never had his father\\'s love or pride . \\nthroughout the picture , phoenix manages to give depth to a character who\\'s scripted as a caricature of evil . \\ni\\'ve been a russell crowe fan since \" romper stomper . \" \\nthis role doesn\\'t offer him the complexities of his parts in \" l . \\na . confidential \" and \" the insider \" -- essentially his job is to grunt heroically -- but his voice , which has a richard burton resonance textured by a clint eastwood rasp , is perfect for the genre . \\nthe late oliver reed gave us the best work of his career in his last role . \\ni hope it will be rewarded with an oscar . \\nmy only major quibble with \" gladiator \" is its stylized look . \\nseveral scenes are tinted . \\nwe\\'ve seen a lot of the tinted look lately , particularly in \" payback \" and \" the matrix . \" \\ni don\\'t get the appeal of the style , which makes feature films look like tv ads . \\nin \" payback \" it was merely annoying , but in \" gladiator \" it bleaches the color out of the grand spectacles that are the raison d\\'etre of the roman epic . \\n ( perhaps it\\'s meant to gloss over the imperfections of the computer-generated shots . ) \\nalso , the battle scenes are filmed in a strange herky jerky style that seems to be slo mo and fast forward simultaneously . \\n ( it reminds me of the way the flash runs in the comic books , leaving a half-blurred trail of images of himself behind . ) \\nwith a more realistic look , \" gladiator \" could be even more satisfying than \" braveheart \" because it has a tighter script and a more fulfilling conclusion . \\nbottom line : a rousing action film enriched by fine performances but tarnished by stylistic choices . \\n',\n",

       "  b'all through its production and into the early days of its initial , aborted pre-release publicity , hard rain bore the appropriate moniker of the flood . \\nultimately , however , paramount pictures , nervous that this movie would be confused with 1996\\'s other , underperforming disaster films ( dante\\'s peak , volcano ) , changed the title and shifted the release date by nearly a year . \\nbut , to paraphrase the bard , swill , by any other name , would smell as rank . \\nno number of name changes can help this picture . \\nit\\'s not just about a disaster , it is a disaster . \\nhard rain is the case of a movie that gets progressively worse with every passing minute . \\nthe best shot occurs during the opening credits , as the camera pans over the streets and byways of huntingburg , indiana as the water level slowly rises . \\nthe community , protected by an overworked dam , is being evacuated as the rain continues to pour relentlessly from the cloud-choked skies . \\nfrom that moment on , it\\'s all downhill . \\nwhatever initial entertainment value the film possesses has long since drained away by the halfway point . \\nit takes forever to get to the end credits -- this is one of the longest-seeming 95-minute motion pictures i have recently endured . \\nbasically , hard rain is one extended , dull chase sequence punctuated by occasional shoot-outs . \\nthere\\'s a lot of water , broken glass , gunfire , and explosions . \\nit\\'s all very routine and uninteresting because there aren\\'t any real characters and the plot only occasionally makes sense . \\nthe film\\'s conclusion is so preposterous that it\\'s almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seeing the monumentally idiotic way that the film makers decide to resolve the myriad subplots that are floating around . \\naction films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating as they rush towards a conclusion . \\ngraham yost , the writer of both speed and hard rain , surely understands that principle . \\nunfortunately , neither he , nor cinematographer-turned-director mikael salomon ( a far off place ) , applies it . \\nthe action in hard rain grows tedious through repetition . \\nwe see the same kinds of things -- speedboat chases , flood damage , shoot-outs , etc . -- over and over again . \\nthe movie constantly recycles about twenty minutes worth of material to pad the running time out to an acceptable movie length . \\nthe storyline gives us a number of paper-thin characters in contrived circumstances . \\nthere\\'s tom ( christian slater ) , the one- dimensional action hero who works as a security guard driving an armored car full of cash . \\nhe and his partner , charlie ( edward asner , tv\\'s \" lou grant \" ) , get stuck on a street that\\'s rapidly turning into a river . \\na group of men , led by jimmy ( morgan freeman ) , arrive on the scene not as rescuers but as robbers . \\nafter charlie is killed in a shoot-out , tom hides the money , then runs . \\nas he swims and boats his way through huntingburg\\'s roads , he encounters some of the locals : karen ( minnie driver ) , a would-be love interest ; a bickering old couple ( richard dysart and betty white ) , who are on hand to provide comic relief ; and the easily-corrupted sheriff ( randy quaid ) , whose seeming helpfulness hides sinister ulterior motives . \\nthere isn\\'t any real acting in this film . \\nchristian slater utters a few lame one-liners and does a lot of mugging for the camera . \\ntom is easily one of the most lifeless characters the actor has brought to the screen . \\nrandy quaid sneers a lot , and is totally unconvincing . \\nmorgan freeman and minnie driver both attempt to give legitimate performances , but they are defeated by the script . \\nfreeman , one of the best cinematic thespians working today , looks suitably embarrassed to be here , but i suppose everyone needs a good paycheck from time-to-time . \\nfollowing in the wake of twister , this is yet another natural disaster movie that doesn\\'t trust nature\\'s fury as the chief engine of conflict . \\nas a result , we are saddled with an idiotic good guys/bad guys story that effectively ruins any potential that the flood tale could have had . \\ntitanic proved that there can be a wealth of drama in a movie where everything goes under water . \\nhard rain successfully demonstrates that the opposite is equally possible . \\nthus far this year , hollywood has already subjected us to its unique brand of moronic mayhem by fire ( firestorm ) and water ( hard rain ) . \\nfortunately , there are only two elements left . \\n',\n",

' \\n`it's funny to see people die ? \\nare you sick or something ? ' \\nmaybe i am and maybe director sam raimi is as well to create such an enigma of a movie . \\nhis unique execution is as sarcastic as subtle , as disturbing as it is hilarious . \\nan example of raimi's odd approach : a monster ( formerly protagonist ash's girlfriend of all people ) is cut in half by a chainsaw and a tidal wave of blood comes from the open wound . \\nsure it's over-the-top , but it is so over-the-top that it is laugh out loud funny ; just try watching ash with a straight face as he unexpectedly is showered with ten gallons of blood , staining his face and knocking him back a few feet . \\nthe whole movie is like this , watch ash get beat up , watch ash defeat the monster , watch ash get beat up again by another even zanier monster . \\nthe more repetitive and unrealistic the movie gets , the more amusing it becomes . \\nno matter how sick it may sound , it is funny to watch bruce ampbell's ash get his butt kicked every five minutes . \\nand raimi takes advantage , he has ash tormented by the head of his girlfriend , by the body of an old lady , even by his own right hand . \\nlike the less superior idle hands , we watch ash uncontrollably hit himself over and over again until he is forced to cut off his own body part . \\nbut it doesn't end , ash now has to fight his severed hand which now moves with the same celerity as thing from the addams family . \\nall of these events , thrown at you from minute one with roller coaster- like camera movements , at first become shocking , then inexplicably funny . \\nraimi expects the audience to laugh and as the film progresses , he seems to be enjoying himself even more by borrowing the classic mirror scene from the marx brothers' duck soup , then bringing more characters into the picture to comically kill them off . \\nwith a running time of less than an hour and a half , raimi gets away with the impossible , making a horror film with more gore than plot and intentionally more laughs than scares . \\nending evil dead ii with an opening for the third film in the series , raimi obviously had a lot of fun making this movie and couldn't wait to make it's sequel . \\n\",\n",

one should start each day considering oneself as dead . \\nliving atop an abandoned building , surrounded by his flock of pet carrier pigeons , ghost dog exists in a netherworld lacking creature comforts and friends . \\nhe craves nothing more . \\nas he puts it late in the film , \" i\\'ve seen all i want to see . \" \\nhe exists in a spiritual world of the mind , gaining moral sustenance from his readings . \\nghost dog wasn\\'t always as he is presented . \\nin several roshomon-like flashbacks , it\\'s shown how ghost dog was assaulted by racist white males and beaten nearly to death until the timely intervention of a good samaritan , that \" samaritan \" being a foot soldier in an aging crime family . \\nghost dog pledges his life to the service of the man , louie ( tormey ) , as repayment . \\nafter years of loyal service , ghost dog is sent , by louie , to kill \" handsome frank \" , a made man within louie\\'s organization who has run away with the crime boss\\'s daughter , louise ( vessey ) . \\nghost dog wordlessly executes his task , witnessed by louise , whom he spares , as she sits watching a betty boop cartoon , clutching a copy of the book , roshomon . \\nin a bit of synchronicity , louise loans the book to ghost dog . \\nupset that frank was taken out by someone not from the family , the mob bosses , in turn , put out a hit on ghost dog in a perverse twist of loyalty to their assassinated comrade . \\nthe rest of movie holds the dated value systems of both the mafia and ghost dog up to the light of a new millennium with many acerbic asides as the two come factions come into conflict . \\nthe theme of old cartoons flares up time and again , each time showing cartoon violence that is in sharp counterpoint to the reality of ghost dog\\'s world . \\neach time a character is shown watching a cartoon , it\\'s from the same era , betty boop , felix the cat , etc . , a reflection of days gone by . \\nnear the end , louise is watching a cartoon that\\'s a departure from the previously shown ones . \\nit\\'s a bit of audacity on jarmusch\\'s part that is nicely effective , despite it\\'s surrealistic nature . \\nas ghost dog floats through his world , his life is touched by two people . \\none is a sage little girl ( winbush ) who connects with ghost dog through their love of reading . \\nshe comes to symbolize a melding of the old ways and new sensibilities , just as louise ultimately does . \\nby film\\'s end , the fact that jamusch is so effective at illustrating the tenuous bond between the two is a testament to his skill as a writer . \\nthe other person in ghost dog\\'s world is an ice cream ( de bankole\\' ) vendor who only speaks french , yet intuitively shares a rapport with ghost dog . \\nthe vendor is the literal stranger in a strange land . \\njarmusch , through rapper/composer rza , underscores his film with rap and reggae music , which at first blush seems dichotomous , but its primal rhythms serve to strengthen the fundamental nature of the movie . \\nghost dog seems to draw some type of strength from the rap music he listens to as he negotiates the streets in various stolen cars . \\n ( which , in and of itself , presents another paradox about ghost\\'s dog\\'s sense of honor . ) \\nthe head mafioso is played by henry silva with a stone faced resignation . \\nof all the cartoonish mobsters , he is the only one who appears self aware of his state in the world . \\ngorman plays sonny , a lieutenant who respects the old ways , yet has a quirky affinity for rap music , a love comically shown in several impromptu displays . \\nruffini seems the truest reflection of the mafia . \\nhe is a husk of a man , assisted by two hearing aids , who barks out advice without truly hearing what he , or others are saying . \\nwhitaker carries the film by using what truly great actor\\'s use , his face . \\nghost dog is reticent to speak , often going for long periods without doing so . \\nthe fact that whitaker can convey such a wide range of emotion through a gesture or look is a remarkable talent . \\nalthough the film has a deliberate pace , some of the late night drives and walks taken by ghost dog dragged the momentum down . \\ntruly tragic is how ghost dog misinterprets japanese honor in his final confrontation with the mob . \\nhe reveals himself to be so desperate for spiritual guidance through the hagakure that he fails to truly adapt it to what is real and true in his world . \\ncarried on the shoulders of a remarkable performance by whitaker , ghost dog rises beyond being a characterization or icon , into a figure that garners sympathy , if not a bit of pity . \\n',\n",

       "  b' \" if there\\'s a beast in men , it meets its match in women , too . \" \\nstarring sarah patterson , angela lansbury , tusse silberg , david warner directed by neil jordan written by jordan and angela carter , from a story by carter cinematography by bryan loftus \\nin recent years , there has been a trend in the field of fantasy : writers have been revisiting the fertile world of myth and fairy tale and reclaiming that world , investing it with new life and energy . \\nin modern times , fairy tales have become disneyfied and debased ; they have become trite adventures involving leering witches , friendly dwarves , and cuddly talking animals . \\nbut in their original forms , fairy tales have a dark , wicked edge . \\ncrows tear out the eyes of cinderella\\'s sisters , a gorier fate then they receive in the animated version . \\nhansel and gretel relish cooking the witch in her own oven . \\nwriters have become fascinated by the bloodier , morally ambivalent aspects of fairy tales , and are now modernizing the old stories while simultaneously going back to their roots . \\nbefore this trend was in vogue , angela carter--whose stories always have a dark , wicked , subversive edge--had been reinventing fairy tales for years . \\nin the company of wolves , she and neil jordan retell the story of red riding hood , enlivening it with werewolves , rolls royces , and a visit from satan . \\nthe story is structured as a dream , occurring in the mind of rosaleen ( sarah patterson ) , an adolescent girl about whose \\'real\\' life we learn very little . \\nwithin the dream , there are a number of inset stories , most told by dream-rosaleen\\'s grandmother ( angela lansbury ) , and these tales gloss the central story in intriguing , suggestive ways . \\nthe result is a surprisingly successful example of a sinister , contemporary fairy tale . \\ni say \" surprisingly \" because there are so many ways this film could have gone wrong . \\nand there are ways in which it does . \\nthe performances are mediocre , except for lansbury\\'s--she finds the right note for the prim , apple-cheeked granny , the wise and stern teller of cautionary tales . \\nthe soundtrack , synth-heavy , reminded me of bad 80s horror movies , as did the special effects in the shapechanging scenes . \\nprobably state-of-the-art at the time , they are now laughable . \\nbut jordan succeeds at what i consider the trickiest aspect of the film : he transcends the poor acting/music/effects and conveys a sense of the fantastic , of otherness . \\none of the problems in adapting full-blown fantasies is that fantasy is often best left to the imagination of the reader , rather than being subjected to the \\'realism\\' of the screen . \\npart of me would love to see an adaptation of \\'the lord of the rings , \\' but , on the other hand , i know that any filmmaker\\'s recreation of ents , hobbits , and balrogs is inevitably going to be really lame compared to what i picture in my mind . \\nthis makes jordan\\'s accomplishment here seem mighty impressive to me : he imbues the company of wolves with a genuine sense of magic and mystery . \\nthe somewhat ruritanian dreamworld becomes a kind of ur-reality . \\nthe sunshine is exceptionally warm and abundant . \\nthe nights are quiet and misty and eerie and ghostly . \\nthe peasant village is rustic and cozy , the woods old and hoary . \\nthis archetypal realm is the setting for a smart , subtle , literate script , a script which is as good as you\\'d expect from jordan ( himself an accomplished fiction writer ) and carter . \\nfor carter , the cauldron of story is a witches\\' brew , bubbling over with primal ingredients : mist-shrouded forests , ancient graveyards , virginal girls and wise women , wolves with glowing eyes . \\nshe adeptly blends them all together . \\nthere is a symbolic richness to the film ; everything is permeated with a sense of significance . \\nthe point of it all , i think , is to represent a girl\\'s rites-of-passage on an unconscious , primordial level . \\na night-journey through the forest , from the village to the grandmother\\'s home , is the crux of the company of wolves . \\n \" don\\'t stray from the path , \" rosaleen is told , again and again , and the path is both literal and figurative : the path through the forest and the path of life . \\nstaying on the path is the conventional approach suggested by rosaleen\\'s elders . \\ncarter and jordan , never conventional , explore what goes on when you leave the path . \\nthose who stray will supposedly meet with a dark fate . \\nthis fate is literalized in the dream as werewolves , but the werewolves connote many things : death , sex , knowledge . \\nif straying from the path leads to death , then it\\'s not a good idea--but if that\\'s what you have to risk to get sex and knowledge ( and therefore power ) , then maybe it\\'s worth the risk . \\nwhen you leave the path , the world becomes a dangerous , ambiguous place , but it\\'s full of potential . \\nand it\\'s certainly more interesting than the disney version . \\n',\n",
       "  b'tone alone cannot sustain a film , but it can go a long way . \\nif i can find myself lost in the time and place of a story , it scores immediate style points . \\nwhen that tone is backed up by an outstanding story and great acting , the effect can be described best by an adjective i do not use lightly : \" literary . \" \\nwhat\\'s eating gilbert grape ? \\nis such a film . \\nit\\'s a rich , memorable and stunningly acted story of desire colliding with responsibility , staged in a manner which many viewers might find too prosaic , but which insinuated itself into my imagination with its confidence . \\ngilbert grape ( johnny depp ) is a young man living in rural endora , iowa , facing incredible responsibilities . \\nas the man of the house since his father\\'s suicide , gilbert must support the family by working at the local grocery store . \\nhe also must watch over his mentally handicapped brother arnie ( leonardo dicaprio ) and help care for his extremely overweight mother ( darlene cates ) . \\ngilbert seems destined to spend the rest of his life in the small town until the arrival in endora of becky ( juliette lewis ) , a free spirit passing through with her grandmother when their truck breaks down . \\nas he spends time with becky , gilbert begins to think about all the things he is missing . \\nslowly his resentment builds , until he realizes that he can no longer live his entire life for other people . \\ndirector lasse hallstrom ( my life as a dog ) and legendary cinematographer sven nykvist create a magnificent visual backdrop for peter hedges\\' screenplay , based on his own novel . \\nendora is a town on the edge of the world represented by the giant foodmart , a tiny insular community where everyone knows everyone else . \\nthe midwestern sunsets and sprawling fields are beautifully photographed , and the atmosphere of the town is intensely real . \\nminor characters , like crispin glover as the town\\'s mortician , are vividly realized , and there are echoes of the last picture show in mary steenburgen\\'s desperately unhappy housewife . \\none of the most perfectly realized scenes focuses on the grand opening of a burger franchise , attended by the entire town and accompanied by the off-key high school band . \\nnot a single note in the depiction of endora rang false . \\nthe same can be said of the character of gilbert . \\nit\\'s testimony to the precision involved in his creation that he came together completely with one perfectly placed line , when becky responds to gilbert\\'s description of his father with , \" i knew someone like that once . \" \\ngilbert is a man harboring an ever-growing bitterness about where he finds himself in life , a bitterness which reveals itself in moments of surprising cruelty . \\nin one scene , he allows local children to look at his mother through their window , displaying her like a side show attraction . \\nhis entire life seems to be mocked by arnie\\'s repeated chants of , \" we\\'re not going anywhere , \" but instead of expressing his dissatisfaction he lets his anger simmer , and it becomes clear that he is following in his father\\'s footsteps in this regard . \\njohnny depp expertly demonstrates the tension central to gilbert by playing everything below the surface , but he never gives in to one-dimensional blankness or simply regurgitates his naif roles in benny & joon and edward scissorhands . \\ndepp\\'s performance is overshadowed , however , by leonardo dicaprio\\'s astonishing oscar-nominated supporting work as arnie . \\nhe puts to shame such big name actors as john malkovich and dustin hoffman , whose mentally challenged characters never seemed completely real . \\ndicaprio is perfect to the last twitch and squeal , and anyone who has ever spent time with mentally challenged kids will be hard-pressed to spot a flaw . \\ndarlene cates , a first-time actor , brings real pain to her scenes as gilbert\\'s tortured mother , and laura harrington and mary kate schellhardt are solid as gilbert\\'s sisters . \\nonly juliette lewis doesn\\'t quite click , playing a critical role with her now familiar dopey drone and too little genuine spark . \\ngilbert grape does seem to drift into its conclusion , but it never lost me . \\nthanks to a lovingly created setting and a marvelous cast , this 1993 release proves well worth the wait . \\n',\n",
       "  b'while the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation , we had yet another shoddy , subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought on by the inexorable hasten from the major studios to please kids with everything they think kids will go for to disburse their seven bucks . \\nand , once again , we have one of the worst films of the year . \\nthe trend of the moment-- and bear in mind it\\'s a trend not a movie - is spawn , and if you\\'ve seen the animated series on hbo you\\'ll recall it embodies the lost life of a disfigured man , an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment : he\\'s been sent to hell . \\ntodd mcfarlane , the creator of the spawn comic book , must have had a tough time sitting through spawn , for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects , style over substance , ambience over anything else . \\nnot only does spawn rely entirely on special effects , the story , about a bewildered individual who must take on a group of * bad guys * and * find himself * in the process is realized in such a sordid , incapable manner , it becomes indigestible after a while . \\nevery character in this film is lifeless , vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student . \\nthe story begins , like in every superhero movie in this age , with a man living an idyllic life . \\nal simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government agent/assassin shares the love of his wife , wanda ( theresa russell ) and daughter , has a tongue-in-cheek , wiseass partner , terry ( d . b sweeney ) and is content with the job his boss , jason wynn ( martin sheen ) , provides him . \\nthe next element in the film is the part when things go awry . \\nand as expected , everyone turns the tables on poor al . \\nas the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological weapons plant , al is befriended by jason , and dies in a gory and truly sickening scene . \\ninevitably , it leads everyone to the conclusion that he has passed away . \\nhence , jason\\'s mischievous master-mind plan , to ` conquer the world \" is just commencing its initial stages , when al makes a pact with satan himself , agreeing to command the devil\\'s army to take over the world and he gets to see his family again . \\nso , our pal al has been uplifted to hell , and while his transformation from normal guy to spawn takes place , his ol\\' partner terry forms a relationship with his wife . \\ntime passes . \\nand now spawn is present in the grotesque inner city , the ghetto where cog ( nicol williamson ) teaches spawn how to utilize his neat artifacts , his motorbike , armor , etc . . . \\nthis character is merely a poor man\\'s obi wan kenobi without all the mythological hoopla . \\nnow the stage is set spawn , the new `enemy of evil\\' vs evil . \\nand evil takes the cake , doubtlessly . \\njohn leguizamo\\'s deliciously heinous performance as the injurious clown working for wynn is the film\\'s relief point . \\nall this anguish , pain , half-baked themes and putrid action scenes are invisible to leguizamo , who steals the show and derives joy from his character , which is basically a compilation of so-so one liners . \\nand then there\\'s martin sheen . \\nwhichever way you look you will find carving boards near his pitying and downright appalling last two years . \\nhis selections calls for an immediate firing of his agent . \\nas the megalomaniac boss , his caricature plays like a bad dream out of a b-movie , scrambled , and left in the shelf to rot . \\nthis is the man that starred in films such as apocalypse now and wall street . \\ni\\'d never thought i\\'d be saying this , but at this juncture , charlie sheen\\'s career is in better shape . \\nspawn is a movie in which realism , or even an attempt to draw a parallel between the problems of the hero and real life is identifiable . \\nfor most of the film the vapid michael jai white consumes his time ogling , jumping through roofs , and performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises which even batman and robin accomplished better . \\nit constantly reminded us we were watching a superhero movie-- a very bad superhero movie . \\ncontinually the film kept on depending on special effects , and sadly , this is how pictures are being made . \\nperhaps no other movie better than spawn illustrates the deterioration of cinema through computer wizardry . \\nthe filmmakers seem to have forgotten every human element possible . \\nthe quality of this film is abysmal and insulting . \\nit is perceptible that director mark dippe , attempted to touch the psychological chord that tim burton\\'s batman did touch , the desperation of a man whose life has all but evaporated in one spontaneous act . \\nbut bruce wayne had human elements to him . \\nhe was pensive , resourceful and had relationships , which made our perspective on him equally human . \\nthe character of al simmons seems to be longing for a drastic change , as if he\\'s fatigued about being normal . \\nand as all superheroes , batman , superman , the phantom , they must possess an element of normal civilians to make us think they are extraordinary . \\nnone of this is present in spawn . \\nthe fighting sequences are weakly executed , the dialogue is penny-dreadful and the art direction an odious duplicate of blade runner\\'s . \\nas an example of this film\\'s vastly creative imagination the writers of spawn decided to include a poor orphan boy who is abandoned and beaten , and then rescued by spawn , so our emotions tend to be a little more sympathetic . \\nadmittedly , i did laugh once in the film , and that\\'s when todd mcfarlane showed up in an unexpected cameo as a bum . \\nit is no wonder why so american children grow up with no engrossment for art or literature . \\nbesides blaming a large portion of it on the laughable school system , i condemn the other part to garbage like spawn . \\nmovies that present no admiration , no captivation , no richness and vague interest in what children are being subjected to . \\nand kids will continue to see films like spawn , simply because they are unable to differentiate what makes an imaginative , wondrous film from an insipid and wasteful one . \\nchildren are not muppets . \\nand spawn unapologetically targets children . \\n',\n",

       "  b' \" mercury rising \" has numerous flaws , but there is one that really stands out : its central plot device is unnecessary . \\nthat\\'s right . \\nthe major aspect of the film , that which is supposed to make it different from other routine government conspiracy / action flicks could be dropped from the beginning , and the movie would turn out exactly the same , if not better . \\nthis central device is the fact that a nine-year-old boy is autistic . \\nhis name is simon , and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped into the back of a puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beat it . \\nsimon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film , and we are supposed to feel for him because he is a poor handicapped child thrown into a violent , unfair world against his will , with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him . \\nthe fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of \" mercury rising . \" \\ni suppose the original novel upon which the movie was based did much more with this aspect of simon\\'s character and his relationship with willis , but here it is lost . \\nmiko hughes , the young actor who plays simon , goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic : he walks slowly , drawls his words , kicks and screams when he\\'s touched , and has a hard time looking at other people . \\nit\\'s a difficult role for an adult , much less a young child , to play , and unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he isn\\'t playing like he\\'s autistic . \\nunlike dustin hoffman\\'s performance in \" rain man \" or leonardo dicaprio\\'s in \" what\\'s eating gilbert grape , \" we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting . \\nhowever , unlike \" rain man \" which used its character\\'s autism in unique and interesting ways to build a credible and touching story , \" mercury rising \" could go right about its generic , predictable plot with simon being simply a really smart but really shy kid . \\nhell , he doesn\\'t even have to be shy . \\nin fact , the movie might have been more interesting if he had had a more active role , rather than just being carted around under willis\\' arm . \\nwillis\\' character , art jeffries , is a disillusioned fbi agent who has been removed from undercover work and is now doing menial tasks like listening to wiretaps with rookies who are happy to be doing anything . \\nhe becomes involved with simon when he is called to check out a murder scene at simon\\'s house , where his father has apparently shot his mother in the back and then committed suicide . \\nof course , we know that isn\\'t the way it happened happen because we saw an evil , square-jawed government hitman with a mean-looking crew-cut knock off the parents . \\nsimon was able to get away , and jeffries finds him hiding in a secret compartment in a closet , which the rest of the chicago police department had overlooked . \\njeffries -- who is accused by several characters at different times of being paranoid although his actions never suggest it -- knows there is something more , and he makes it his personal mission to go against everything and everyone in order to protect simon . \\nthis is quite a task because that same hitman who knocked off simon\\'s parents is crawling everywhere , attempting to kill simon at the hospital , on the highway , and every other place he goes . \\nlate in the movie , jeffries is forced to enlist the aid of a pretty young woman named stacey ( kim dickens ) who he meets at a coffee shop . \\nof all the hard-to-believe aspects of the movie , this is the worst . \\ni can believe in the decency of the human heart , but stacey\\'s character is far too accommodating . \\nnot only does she agree to watch simon while jeffries runs off to solve the mystery , she lets him into her apartment at two o\\'clock in the morning when she knows the police is after him , and then lets him leave simon in her apartment which means that she has to forgo a business trip that is desperately needed to pay the rent . \\nthe grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point . \\nthe movie might have been redeemed by some good action sequences , but even here \" mercury rising \" doesn\\'t rise to the challenge . \\nthe movie was directed by harold becker , who has made some good suspense films including \" sea of love \" ( 1989 ) and \" malice \" ( 1993 ) , but his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion . \\nthere is one fight on a streetcar between jeffries and another hitman ( played by peter stormare ) that is so ineptly directed , shot and edited , that i had no idea 1 ) exactly where they were on the streetcar , 2 ) who was hitting who , and 3 ) where this hitman came from and how he knew where jeffries and simon were . \\nthe grand finale takes place on the roof of a tall building , and features a harrowing ( yawn ) scene where simon walks along the very edge of the building , not because he has to , but because it\\'s more suspenseful that way . \\ntaken as a whole , \" mercury rising \" is an tepid , confused movie that lacks style , wit , and any traces of a sense of humor . \\nusually willis brings his personal brand of understated humor to his roles , but here he is too straight and serious . \\nthis is because the movie wants to be an action flick and a heartfelt drama at the same time , but it ends up failing on both fronts . \\nmaybe the book was better , but the way it\\'s handled here is a perfect case study in formula filmmaking guaranteed to bore . \\n',\n",

\\ntime will tell , but i\\'m sure that mr . mouse has nothing to fear . \\nthis may sound like i didn\\'t like antz ; on the contrary , i\\'d put it up there with toy story . \\nbut due to it\\'s pg rating , many parents may be put off by some of the dialogue which shouldn\\'t appear in disney\\'s version . \\nsome of the dialogue in antz pushes the envelope for a family-oriented film . \\nsexual innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally , which makes dreamworks\\' animated feature geared more for an adult crowd . \\nthe humor is also written especially for adults , though many kids were laughing in the theater i attended . \\nthis is the type of film that should be made for families more often : entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents . \\nantz begins with a hilarious monologue which seems a meld between woody allen\\'s shtick and franz kafka\\'s metamorphosis , the short story of a man who wakes up to discover himself as a bug . \\nz ( allen ) is a troubled ant , believing he was not made to be a worker . \\n \" when you\\'re the middle child in a family of five million . . . \" he comments about his neglected childhood . \\none night , z is sitting in a bar with his friend weaver ( sylvester stallone ) , discussing his pathetic place in life . \\nin walks princess bala ( sharon stone ) , whom no one recognizes without a crown . \\nbala asks z is he would like to dance , and they engage in a pulp fiction-esque dance while everyone else is following the leader . \\nafter discovering that she is the princess , z falls in love , but there\\'s a problem : bala is getting married to general mandible ( gene hackman ) , a ruthless leader who merely wants to control a better and stronger colony . \\nin order to do that , he must eliminate not only the queen ( anne bancroft ) , but the weakest of the colony , namely the worker ants . \\nbut to get rid of the queen , he needs to get rid of the loyal army ants who would be willing to die for her . \\nhe and colonel cutter ( christopher walkin ) come up with a plan to send the loyal ants off to battle , where they will surely be killed . \\nthe queen is reluctant at first , but decides it is best for the colony . \\nmeanwhile , z wants to meet bala again , and he asks weaver , an army ant , to switch places with him . \\nso z gets sent off to battle , but he manages to survive the slaughter by the termites . \\nthe battle sequence is absolutely stunning , though you may have flashbacks to starship troopers , which contained a very similar sequence . \\nhowever , antz and that 1997 film were both in production around the same time , so the similarities are merely coincidence . \\nthe second half of the film revolves around z\\'s kidnapping of bala , and their search for a mythical place called insectopia . \\nthere , an ant can be his own boss and have all the food he wants . \\nthe adventures z and bala get into are surprisingly high in tension , especially one involving a magnifying glass . \\nlooming over the targets like the spaceships from independence day ( in fact , i\\'m just going to assume that the producers referenced id4 intentionally ) . \\nthe ants look up in awe , and then a beam of fire blasts into the ground . \\nvisually , it\\'s an exciting rush of adrenaline . \\nbut don\\'t be fooled . . . \\nlittle kids shouldn\\'t see this , as they may just try and copy it . \\nafter seeing antz , i vowed never to intentionally step on an ant again . \\nhopefully , children will learn that killing ants is rather cruel . \\nas an animated film , antz is probably the best you will find to date . \\nvisually , it\\'s as stunning as what dreams may come . \\nthe best aspect of animation is the fact that the characters aren\\'t limited by gravity . \\nthey can take ridiculous situations and make them seem plausible . \\none great moment involves a mass of worker ants bunching up to form a wrecking ball . \\nthe animation is so perfect that you can virtually see every single ant on the ball . \\nhowever , the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck to the bottom of a young boy\\'s shoe . \\nit\\'s truly a great example of film making at its finest . \\nwith computer technology , the animators have carefully made the ants\\' faces look similar to the actors providing the voices . \\nthe best example would have to be barbatus ( danny glover ) . \\nat one point , you can even see the pores on his face ( although , i doubt ants have pores . . . \\ndo they ? ) . \\nbarbatus also has a touching but rather gruesome scene as he has his final words with z without a body . \\nyoung kids may be disturbed by the site of a dismembered head , but a good deal of humor is derived ( more appropriate for adults , of course ) . \\ndisney\\'s a bug\\'s life looks good , but i don\\'t know if they will be able to best dreamworks\\' newest animated feature in terms of animation . \\nif not , then dreamworks will have done something no other studio could do : go head to head with the big mouse , and knock him down ( yes , anastasia was good , but not nearly as good as even the worst of disney ) . \\nvocal talent is always essential to an animated feature , and antz has one of the best line-ups seen since toy story . \\nin fact , it far exceeds that one . \\nwoody allen has always been funny , but here he transcends most of what he\\'s done in the past few years . \\nwithout a body , his comic timing is the most noticeable thing . \\nin fact , i\\'m pretty sure that the writers let him improvise a lot of his lines . \\nsharon stone as bala shows off some of her comic ability , though for the most part , stone works best as a dramatic actress . \\nsylvester stallone ( teamed up with stone once again ) is beginning to solidify his statement that he wants to be an actor , not a typecast action star . \\nafter a snub at the oscars last year , stallone is proving himself as the serious ( or comedic , as illustrated here ) actor that he is . \\ngene hackman is superb as the gruff-talking general , almost doing another take on his crimson tide persona . \\nchristopher walkin is probably more noticed by his voice , and so many people will remember him from such hits as batman returns . \\nanne bancroft has a minimal role , but she\\'s effective nonetheless . \\ndanny glover has a small role , but he does a very , very good job . \\ndan aykroyd and jane curtin also lend their voices as two lovesick , euro-trash bees--both are very unrecognizable , especially aykroyd . \\njennifer lopez plays a worker ant who falls in love with weaver , although most people won\\'t recognize her voice either . \\nmany people will recognize grant shaud\\'s voice as the foreman . \\nhe played miles on the tv show murphy brown . \\nthis is definitely a huge cast with some high-profile names , and it will definitely help it\\'s grosses . \\nof course , you can probably tell where a lot of the $60 million budget went to , also . \\ndirectors eric darnell and lawrence guterman are relative newcomers ( though guterman did direct a 1994 feature , headless ! ) . \\nbut both show an incredible talent for this type of a picture . \\ntense at times , and very funny throughout , the two hold this film together like professionals . \\nthe screenplay by todd alcott and chris weitz is quite simple in plot , but it contains a lot of subtlety that makes the film more suitable for adults . \\nkids will delight in the animation , while parents can laugh heartily at the humor . \\nmost of it will go over young children\\'s heads . \\ndoes that mean you shouldn\\'t take kids to see it ? \\nnot at all . \\nthey will have a lot of fun watching this one . \\nwhat is great is the themes that are given to us . \\npart social commentary , part romance story , and part moral drama , antz gives everyone something to talk about , whether it be the animation , or the discussions of individualism and community . \\nthankfully , it\\'s not subtle in either aspects . \\nantz is rated pg for mild language and some intense action . \\nsometimes the language can be pushing the limits for a family movie , but the violence is what should keep kids at home . \\nthe battle scene has ants melting in acid , and bugs being speared to death . \\nand the magnifying scene shows an ant disintegrate in the beam of sunlight . \\nbut other than that ( and some sexual innuendos ) , it\\'s a perfect choice for some wholesome fun at the theaters . \\ni doubt many children will understand the sexual innuendos unless they are old enough , but it\\'s still advisable to leave really young children at home . \\nhave i confused you enough ? \\nif you do take your kids , i recommend seeing the film with them , because more than likely , you\\'ll enjoy it the most . \\n',\n",

these are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots . \\nexcept for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city , the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table . \\nthe reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves to it . \\nwe\\'re given a nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations , and good actors to play them . \\nmatt damon is very natural as mike , who struggles between his desire to play the straight and narrow by finishing law school , and answering what may be his true calling , playing professional poker . \\ned norton\\'s worm is truly a worm , always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what they\\'re worth . \\njohn turturro , who amazes me with his acting range , tones it down in this film by playing joey knish , a virtual poker prodigy in his time who now plays the underground games to make rent and child support payments . \\nhe\\'s both a friend and mentor to mike , and turturro\\'s low-key performance is totally convincing , just as john malkovich\\'s heavily-accented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself . \\nmartin landau is also thrown into the mix as one of mike\\'s law professors , abe petrovsky . \\nwhile landau slips well into the role , his character , spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true to one\\'s self , facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward a predictable ending . \\nperhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable line-up of acting talent , however , is gretchen mol who just didn\\'t seem to have much presence on screen . \\nshe\\'s a genuine peach to look at , kind of a cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel ( and i wouldn\\'t be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blond-haired triumvirate and attempted to take over the world ) , but her delivered lines seemed very flat , and i found myself looking for matt damon\\'s reactions instead . \\na good thing about rounders is that it doesn\\'t get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it can\\'t find time for humor . \\nthe film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going , such as a sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game to the next , in widely different locales . \\none game in a cigar club had me in stitches . \\n \" i love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper , \" says one of the players , clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the cards in his other . \\ni was hoping mike and worm would really take these guys . \\nwith all the poker being played , rounders had the potential to be very confusing . \\nyou might think you know a lot about poker , but think again . \\nluckily , we\\'re given a narration by damon during the more intricate moments to explain what\\'s going on . \\nthe narrations are more informative than intrusive , and apprise us of what the stakes are and why certain players want to do the things they do . \\nit\\'s nice that as the characters develop , so does our comprehension of their world . \\nas a film about success and survival in the realm of underground poker , rounders delivers in spades . \\nwait ! \\nas a film about the culture of cards , rounders is an ace . \\nhang on ! \\npacked with great acting and great characters , rounders is a full house . \\nokay , i guess that\\'s enough . \\noh , by the way , if you ever want to get into a game with ol\\' gabe kaplan , be sure to bring a note from epstein\\'s mother . \\n',\n",
       "  b\"the laserman : somehow the title of writer-director-producer peter wang's film conjures up images of superheroes , like ultraman and spiderman . \\nyou kind of expect an adventure flick about a crime fighter who can shoot laser beams from his fingertips . \\nas it turns out , the laserman _is_ about crime and about laser beams , but there aren't any superheroes . \\ninstead , wang's film is populated by a group of refreshingly off-beat characters living in the ultimate cultural melting pot : new york city . \\nthe laserman is a comic brew which celebrates ethnicity , eccentricity , and electricity . \\nthe film tells the bizarre story of arthur weiss ( marc hayashi ) , a chinese-american laser scientist whose life becomes incredibly hectic after he accidentally kills his lab assistant in an experiment . \\nhe loses his job but finds work with a mysterious company which secretly plans to use laser technology to commit dastardly deeds . \\narthur's professional life is cluttered with moral dilemmas . \\nhis personal life , on the other hand , is cluttered with colorful friends and quirky relatives . \\nin fact , arthur is by far the blandest character in the film , despite a charismatic performance by hayashi ( the san francisco-based actor whose films include chan is missing and the karate kid ii ) . \\nit's the auxiliary characters who give the laserman its unique spark . \\narthur's not-so-typical jewish mother , ruth , for example , is convinced that a chinese soul is trapped in her jewish body . \\nshe has dyed her red hair black , she takes herbal medicine daily , and she is perpetually cooking up strange delicacies , such as matzo balls in soy sauce--the ultimate fusion of jewish and chinese cuisine . \\nveteran stage actress joan copeland takes the part and runs with it , almost stealing the movie in the process . \\nshe plays ruth as a driven woman , determined to overcome her genetic heritage by immersing herself in chinese culture . \\narthur's girlfriend janet ( maryann urbano ) is a kooky free-spirit who would rather meditate than copulate ; her ultimate goal is orgasm through zen meditation . \\narthur's best friend , joey ( tony leung ) , is a small time thief who hustles everything from microwave ovens to machine guns . \\njoey is married to arthur's jewish sister , but he is also having an affair with a chinese immigrant who works in a whore house . \\narthur's 11-year-old son , jimmy , played by the amazingly adorable david chan , is--horror of horrors--bad at math ! \\nhe finds it impossible to meet his father's lofty expectations . \\nthe various people in arthur's life come together to form a rich tapestry of humanity . \\nlike wang's earlier film , a great wall ( about a san francisco family visiting relatives in china ) , the laserman revolves around cultural differences . \\nevery character in the film is , in some way or another , trying to find his identity--struggling to negotiate a balance between his native culture and the american way . \\nthe movie also offers a provocative look at technology . \\nwang appears in the movie as lieutenant lu , a detective who is fed up with machines , even though he relies on them to do his job . \\nthe film views technology with a wary eye , acknowledging its necessity while at the same time realizing its potential dangers . \\nwang raises the time-honored question of whether scientists should be held responsible for their inventions . \\nwas einstein responsible for the a-bomb ? \\nis arthur weiss responsible for his lasers ? \\nthe movie pits spirituality against technology , man against machine , and the result is a draw . \\naccording to the film , technology has its place , but we must employ it with great forethought and caution . \\nironically , by its very nature , the laserman is a triumph of technology--the technology of filmmaking . \\nwang's direction is exquisite , especially during the tense finale in which the director frantically cross-cuts between the various subplots , perhaps in homage to d . w . \\ngriffith . \\ncinematographer ernest dickerson , who has worked on all of spike lee's films , gives the laserman a distinctive , artistic look . \\nmason daring's score , which includes a send-up of bach , is right on target . \\nthe laserman is an ambitious endeavor , which is to be applauded , but it's sometimes ambitious to a fault . \\nwang serves up so many slices of life in the film that it's hard to digest them all . \\nfor instance , one character ( arthur's sister ) has negligible screen time , and consequently we just don't care about her marital problems . \\nin weaving his web , wang has included a few too many strands . \\noverall , however , the laserman is a charmingly eclectic concoction . \\non the surface , the film is a light and bouncy comedy-thriller , overflowing with whimsical humor and visual style . \\nthe heavier issues emerge only when you take a deeper look at the film . \\nyou can ponder the moral questions or you can just sit back and enjoy the absurdity of life in china town . \\n\",\n",
       "  b'of circumcision , psychic wounds and the family sitcom \\nthe opening segment is something of a foretaste of this film . \\nthere\\'s a guy\\'s voice telling us how he tries to imagine what his biological parents look like , and on the screen we see images of a variety of oldish men and women . \\nas his imagination plays o n , he ( and we ) picture these motley characters in a mix-and-match shuffle of unlikely marriages , businesswomen with bums , matrons with paint salesmen , the images coming on in a faster and faster frenzy . \\nit\\'s not just a witty , funny summing up of the film \\'s themes - you might not guess it yet , but it sets the pattern for the way the story goes on . \\nwhat starts out as a step in a fairly sensible direction , gets taken on a road trip , put through a detour or two and finds itself freewheeling towards an immin ent crash . \\nthat may not sound so different from the average family sitcom , and the general idea of the film doesn\\'t , at first , seem so wildly distant from standard-issue hollywood comedy : man who was adopted as a child ( ben still er ) sets out on a journey to meet his real parents , along with his wife ( patricia arquette ) , his baby , and a pretty psychology-researcher ( tea leoni ) in tow . \\nvarious mix-ups , shenanigans , oddball characters and , yup , disasters follow . \\nbut if you think you\\'ve been here before , the dialogue and the direction ( by david o . russell , who made spanking the monkey ) take it into another dimension . \\nthe dreaded t-name seems an inevitable reference point ( what with a drug overdose scene and the casting of arquette from true romance ) but really the point is that the foot-massage master hasn\\'t got a monopoly on plot twists and fast , funny , irreverent lines , or on the absurdities of ordinary speech . \\nwhether it\\'s about circumcision , psychic wounds , oral sex , carjacking , the beauties of the armpit area , or ronald reagan , the script never seems to run out of hilarious invention . \\nthe best thing is how these words aren\\'t just there for the punchlines , but are great precisely because they\\'re said in character , like tea leoni\\'s neurotically-charged psychobabbler who\\'s able to say under assault , \" it\\'s understandable if you find this threatening \" . \\nthe cast is excellent throughout , and , rather than singling out anybody , kudos are due to the fine ensemble acting , with the sometimes frenetically overlapping dialogue and the sense of a dozen different reagents colliding to the point of fission . \\nthere are some elements of a woody allen film in this ( not to mention the hand-held camera and loose , improvisational feel of some scenes ) . \\nlike allen , russell\\'s interests are in the volatile sexual politics of couples and the neurotic obsessions in both pare nts and children ( and everybody , really ) . \\nstill , if you\\'re expecting a privileged moment of revelation and emotional outpouring a la \" murphy brown \" / \" frasier \" / fill-in-the-blank-american-comedy , well , it won\\'t happen . \\nthe film sets up expectations like these , with the lead character\\'s search f or his origins and his hopes of self-healing , only to knock them down . \\nif the conventional sitcom structure is to put a slightly loopy family in catastrophic conditions only to rediscover their essential lovey one-ness , flirting with disaster\\'s charact ers embark on a journey to seek that essential state but find themselves only plunging into more weirdness and dysfunctional chaos the further they go . \\nand that , the film suggests , is the essential family state - and you better learn to love it . \\nsomehow , this is perversely feelgood cinema , right up to its manic end . \\n',\n",
       "  b'over 40 years ago , a japanese production company called toho introduced the land of the rising sun to gojira , a reptilian creature of immense proportions created by mankind\\'s nuclear testing . \\npartly flight of fancy , partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry , gojira emerged from the ocean to terrorize tokyo . \\na year later , gojira was marketed to the united states by adding three things : a new name , a dubbed english track , and raymond burr . \\nas godzilla , the film took on the rest of the world . \\nthirty years later , toho remade the classic film and once again took it to the american market by adding the same three things ( yes , including raymond burr ) and called it godzilla 1985 . \\nnow it\\'s 14 years after toho\\'s remake , and director roland emmerich has allowed the giant lizard to make an american first run . \\nin emmerich\\'s godzilla , matthew broderick plays dr . niko tatopoulos , a biologist who is called in to join other scientists in the south pacific already studying the existence of a radiation-induced super mutant which leaves footprints the size of livingrooms . \\nwhen the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the hudson river , tatopoulos and the rest of the team relocate themselves back to the states . \\nmeanwhile , tatopoulos\\'s college girlfriend , audrey timmonds ( maria pitillo ) , works in new york city as an assistant to a big-time news reporter . \\nshe\\'d like to be a reporter herself , and when godzilla comes ashore , she figures this is her big break . \\nof course , with the big guy running amok in the city , niko and audrey are bound to cross paths , and are joined by victor \" animal \" palotti ( hank azaria ) , audrey\\'s trusty cameraman friend , and phillipe roche ( jean reno ) , an operative for the french government , whose nuclear testing started the whole problem in the first place . \\ntogether they attempt to find and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla . \\nwith the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses and the clout of one of the nation\\'s premiere movie production companies , one would think emmerich could make a film truly deserving of the name godzilla . \\nhe didn\\'t . \\nright up there with the lost world , godzilla is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history . \\nthe plot is pretty much what we expect : the big dinosaur-like creature comes out of the water and starts smashing new york city , and it\\'s up to our heroes to figure out why this thing is on its rampage and how it can be stopped , while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down . \\nthe script , however , is painfully bad . \\nit\\'s fraught with lines so corny , they don\\'t even belong in b-movies , and includes many character actions which make you think , \" you idiot , \" or \" you stupid girl . \" \\ni suppose when you\\'ve got a movie with a giant lizard loose in new york , any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well . \\nwhy is it that godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them , but is conveniently able to leap atop others ? \\nwhy do helicopters have to follow godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight of him , when they could more easily keep track of him by flying a little higher and in a straight line ?

\\nokay , maybe the last one was a bit nit-picky , but hey , i was on a roll . \\nbroderick is usually a good actor , but in this film he\\'s weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way . \\nhank azaria does what he can , but don\\'t expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage . \\nlike broderick\\'s , azaria\\'s character is quite simply lacking in color . \\nwhat really annoyed me was maria pitillo , who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse with her acting . \\ncasting must have been asleep on this one . \\nthe one bright spot here is jean reno , who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role which is often comedic , quite unlike what we\\'ve seem him do in the past . \\nalthough his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster , reno brings a style to the role of phillipe which makes him enjoyable . \\nunfortunately , the same cannot be said of the other incongruities . \\nthe entire feel of the movie is tongue-in-cheek , and seems to pay comical homage to a dozen or so films that have come before it . \\nthis results in a significant amount of parody , which contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster , and ends up just producing a mess . \\nmost of the characters seem to be there for comic relief , and almost none are smart enough for the audience to take seriously . \\nalthough emmerich obviously wanted to make a fun action picture , what good is it to sink millions into a cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined by the humans he threatens ?

       "  b'the most common ( and in many cases the only ) complaint against francis ford coppola\\'s 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia , which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour , loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler , kinder ages . \\nmartin scorsese , another italoamerican moviemaker , confronted that perspective with his own , more down-to-earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets , movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime . \\nunfortunately for scorsese , his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola\\'s influence on mafia portrayals in the movies . \\nseventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime . \\nthis film was goodfellas , epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s . \\ngoodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story , told in best-seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi ( who would co-write the screenplay for the film ) . \\nthe book , as well as the film , chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill ( played by ray liotta ) , irish-italian criminal from new york . \\nat the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero ( played by paul sorvino ) , local mob boss , and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands . \\nafter couple of years , together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito ( played by joe pesci ) , he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway ( played by robert de niro ) . \\nthree of them spend years as best friends and associates , gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history . \\nwealth , influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen ( played by lorraine bracco ) , who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities , domestic abuse , arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business . \\nbut the perfect world of \" wiseguys \" gradually begins to fall apart - tommy\\'s unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence , jimmy\\'s reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and , finally , henry\\'s own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends . \\ngoodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory . \\nscorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker . \\nworld depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating . \\nscorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence , hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime , yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny . \\nafter being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history ( based on some notorious real life events ) , the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths , trading the superficial and short-lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens . \\nscorsese also manages to break viewer\\'s moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material - scenes that depict personal tragedies , broken homes , human depravity , violence , bloodshed and murder - in all their uncompromising reality , but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience . \\nwith the use of ironic soundtrack , manipulative shots , character\\'s dialogue or narrator\\'s commentary , goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era . \\neven if we don\\'t pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining , we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker . \\nfirst , we might notice unusual structure of the plot - relatively minor subplot is used as movie\\'s ironic prologue . \\nthen , instead of single narrator , scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards . \\nthis multiple points of views , both in terms of narration and various subjective shots , only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation . \\nsame ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack . \\nnostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy-listening 1950s pop songs , while depression , paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s and 1970s . \\nbut the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment - almost pastoral , easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed . \\nhowever , thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people . \\nsuch scenes , although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings , became very popular among other directors in 1990s . \\nfragmentary character of the screenplay , which doesn\\'t have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes , gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese . \\nhe uses this structure of film to experiment , and most successful of such experiments is hilarious \" a day in life \" segment near the end of the film . \\nanother essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents . \\nthe most respectable among them is robert de niro , but his character , who happen to be most quiet and business-like member of criminal trio , gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues . \\njoe pesci deserved his \" oscar \" for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy , and his lines , including ad-libs , probably represent the most memorable element of the film . \\nray liotta , although equally talented , perhaps doesn\\'t look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film . \\nliotta\\'s henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low-level street thugs . \\nliotta , on the other hand , improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction . \\nlorraine bracco is , on the other hand , very effective and believable as karen hill , wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband . \\npaul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso , and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small-time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave . \\nas a combination of clever sociological study , black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do - work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time . \\nbecause of this achievement , and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers , this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of 1990s . \\n',\n",

       "  b\"last summer , a feature-length version of the avengers hit theaters to the tune of a unanimous critical panning . \\nbased on the famous 60's television show , the film was an enormous box-office flop and a huge disappointment for warner bros . a year later , the studio is up to their old tricks again , with the unnecessary revival of the robert conrad program the wild , wild west . \\nbut it sounded promising : the same tag-team of star will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , who both contributed to make men in black such a financial success , is at the reins again . \\nand co-star kevin kline is attached to the project , as well as a substantial budget to spice up the special effects . \\ni mean , what could possibly go wrong ? \\nthe answer is just about everything . \\nwild wild west is a cinematic abomination - a film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that it is never given a proper chance to get out of the gate . \\nthere are a lot of fancy special effects , and a handful of distinguished actors who try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot and make a lasting impression . \\nbut the script is so deliriously uneven , the entire movie so off course , that no human being or technical achievement has a chance to salvage it . \\nat square one , we have a bizarre case of casting . \\nwill smith plays james west , a renegade cowboy who was originally played by white actor robert conrad in the tv series . \\nmy guess regarding the casting of african-american smith is a simple one : the actor + a cozy summertime release = big bucks for all those involved . \\nsmith is a very talented performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief material , but this is not an ideal role for him . \\nhe's too much of a joker . \\ni heard that initial casting included george clooney in the lead role , and frankly , that sounds a lot more plausible . \\nwhat makes matters worse is that smith goes through the role with such self-assurance in his eyes ; you can practically sense his contentment with the fact that he knows wild wild west will be a huge hit at the summer box office . \\nthe plot involves west and cross-dressing government agent artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , who are assigned by the president to recover a group of kidnapped scientists . \\nthe trail leads to the diabolical dr . arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , a man with no lower body who speaks in a dry , witty southern accent . \\nloveless has taken the country's top technical minds hostage so that they can assist in his deranged plan of total government control , using lethal superweapons to destroy entire towns . \\none such weapon is an 80-foot mechanical tarantula , bearing eight spindly legs of thrashing metal and spewing enormous fireballs left and right . \\nthe visual effects that bring this metallic bug to life are spectacular , seamlessly blending computer-generated imagery with the western surroundings . \\nunfortunately , all of these effects seem so detached from the story , and can do little to support the film's plot deficiencies , which are undoubtedly the main problem . \\nwild wild west is a running gag that never truly works . \\nmost of the jokes , usually care of smith , die on arrival . \\nif it's one thing that could possibly be the saving grace , it's the performances , and even they are mostly off-kilter and poorly delivered . \\nkline is admirable , but he has little to do but invent silly devices on the spot . \\nsalma hayek is wasted as the romantic interest , because she is viewed as little more than that - window dressing to look pretty and create conflict between west and gordon . \\nbranagh , an esteemed shakespearean actor and director , adds marginal enjoyment to the film . \\nbut even he is so utterly weird and over-the-top . \\nrarely is a film so lost in itself as wild wild west is . \\ni suppose there's always one turkey of the summer season ; a highly anticipated , big-budget release that manages to completely disappoint . \\nwild wild west is such a movie , and will probably go down as one of the biggest disappointments of 1999 . \\nbut it is highly unlikely that this will go down in defeat at the box office . \\nperhaps after this , audiences will be less assured when they see will smith's name stamped on a summer movie . \\nafter such hits as independence day and mib , wild wild west is not an impressive addition to the resume . \\n\",\n",

of years , lying around in vaults san a distributor , and having critics waiting to either hail it a masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit . \\nwhen seeing this film , after all the hoopla ,

surprisingly heartbreaking one , which is why it\\'s such a good novel , and why this is such a good film . \\nthe story of a pedophile obsessed with a young 14-year old girl named dolores a . k . a . lolita is great because it\\'s not trash for the perverted but because it\\'s about human obsession with things that are out of one\\'s reach . \\nits protagonist , the comically-named humbert humbert , is not your average pedophile , but a seriously wounded human being who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsessions and idosyncrasies . \\nthe character of lolita is almost a symbol of the forbidden apple in christian mythology , something that will destroy us but that we can\\'t live without . \\nthese ideas are all worked into this film nicely , but done in a way that is not heavy-handed at all , but instead lyrical and emotionally devastating . \\nthe focus of this film , and the reason for making it , it seems , was to really penetrate the emotional depths of the novel and bring them to life on the screen in beautifully dramatic images , and scenes which are blatantly over-stylized . \\nthe tone of the book is a comical one , but it\\'s also a tragic one , and humbert , telling the story from his perspective , blows every single thing out of perspective . \\nhumbert exists in a fantsy world of his obsessions and desires , and this reflects the way the entire film has been designed . \\nwe get a sense that perhaps it\\'s by doing this that humbert has really trapped himself into a fate that will ultimately leave him haggard and destroyed . \\nhe weeps uncontrollably and never lets himself get over his original 14-year-old love , and allows himself to embody her as lolita . \\nhe lets his feelings for her navigate all his decisions , and by the end , he has nothing but overly-dramatic feelings for her . \\nthe story recognizes the extreme of this , almost out of a test , seeing if the readers will really sympathize with someone who is socially deemed a pervert , and one almost wonders while reading the book if the author , vladimir nabokov , wrote the book as a means to bring into focus his own sick obsessions , and perhaps bring them to peace . \\nthe weirdest thing about this film is that by the end , when humbert has reached the finale of his obsessional journey , we can easily sympathize and even identify with him . \\nthe opening and final images of the film are the same , and who hasn\\'t done a similar action , that is wandering about without any sense of reality or anything else but a deep sadness in us ? \\nthis is the second time the novel has been adapted for the screen , the first time being filmed in - shock - 1962 , by stanley kubrick , who couldn\\'t possibly have brought the novel to the screen with as much faithfulness as lyne has been able to do , but did the next best thing : he economized for everything and came up with a droll black comedy about obsession in general . \\nin that film , he used the traps of society as benefits . \\nthe studio demanded the final scene , that of a heinous murder , come first in the film so to portray humbert first as a murderer and second as a pedophile . . . and \\nwhen you see it , it gives the film depth of a man trapped by obsession . \\nthe censors wouldn\\'t allow anymore than a couple glances and subtle dialogue to show the , um , relationship between humbert and lolita , so kubrick decided to play it as comedy , but still allow the tragedy to seep through . \\nlooking at these two versions , especially after reading the novel ( and we all know that when we\\'ve read a novel and see a film adaptation , we are bound to be angered by any size differences ) , it\\'s really impossible to compare them . \\nthey both go for different things , and one has a lot more room to be as sexually frank as the novel was . \\nand although it\\'s true that several scenes are similar , and are thus up for comparison , overall it\\'s unfair to say which one is better and which one is worse . \\ni have never been one for saying the level of greatness of a film adaptation of a novel is deemed by how faithful it is , and i won\\'t say that here . \\nhowever , this film is pretty amazing , mostly because hey , i loved the book , and this film nearly reminded me of it . \\nit doesn\\'t have nearly as much wit ( a couple comical scenes , and even a lot of good chuckles , but just not totally witty ) , but it does have the same emotional toll that the novel had . \\nsome of that is in the casting of the two leads . \\njeremy irons , with his deep , soft british voice and gentle look , is an amazing humbert . \\nhe\\'s droll in a very unique way , and , well , no one can look distraught the way he does . \\nhe brings a wonderful sympathy to the role that goes beyond pathos and really comes up as being easy to identify with the audience . \\nand when he looks at lolita with love , and she looks at him with lust , you know that he\\'s her prisoner for as long as he lives . \\nand dominique swain , who plays the title character , is rather incredible . \\nshe pulls off the tough role even better than sue lyon did in the original , wonderfully balancing the qualities of seduction , bratiness , and self-centeredness that marks the character . \\nit\\'s easy to see why she surrenders to humbert : she loves the attention , and knows that she can have her way with him at any time . \\nwhen he denies her something , she blackmails him effortlessly ( a scene involving a rocking chair and a little foot action is damn near classic ) , and when he stands up to her , she weeps and runs away , leaving humbert to follow her . \\nthere are two other minor characters in the film , one who\\'s a road block in the beginning , and the other who\\'s a reappearing threat to the relationship . \\nthe former is charlotte , lolita\\'s mother , played by melanie griffith . \\nin the book , charlotte is a monster of a woman : overbearing , constantly scolding her child , overly-religious , and ultimately selfish . \\nand she\\'s the one obstacle humbert has to overcome to obtain his goal , at least in the beginning . \\nas played by shelly winters in the original , she represented all these qualities ; as played by griffith here , she\\'s about half of them . \\nit\\'s annoying to watch a film and play a game where you try to see who could have done the role way better than the one on screen without mentioning the actor who played them first . \\nand even though griffith is not really bad , persay , she\\'s nothing more . \\nthe other is clare quilty , the writer who is also trying to seduce lolita , and succeeds , but at a price . \\nlangella takes a totally different direction than the one peter sellars took in the original . \\nquilty was a comic character in the original : a threat in the form of many forms , popping in states of rambling , german , proning , and eventually drunk . \\nlangella takes the other route , allowing all of the creepiness to be unearthed , and the result is a character who exists in shadows and low shots , and who meets a wonderfully ironic ending , the exact opposite of what we thought of him . \\nas you can see , most of these are not improvements or mistakes done on the part of lyne and his screenwriter , stephen schiff , but just parts of a whole new look at the novel , at least cinema-wise . \\nthis version is beautiful , and perpetually saddening . \\nthe camera movements are stylized , and each shot is breathtakingly rich . \\nthe acting is for the most part wonderful , and when we watch it , we really get a sense that for humbert , who is telling the story , the only two people on earth most of the time were humbert and lolita . \\nmore importantly , it takes us right up the brink of emotion , then jumps right over it . \\nby the end , with humbert sadly driving recklessly in his car , following what he says is the only part of his life he doesn\\'t regret , we feel that we all lose to something we can never have . \\n',\n",
       "  b'these days , people have rather short attention span and hardly anything can satisfy them for the long run . \\n1970s nostalgia is already wearing off , and now , people are becoming more and more interested in 1980s . \\nfew years in the future , early 1990s are going to be regarded as next golden age of nostalgia . \\nhowever , i doubt that people are going to be very nostalgic about the hollywood products of that period . \\none of the reason would surely be films like national lampoon\\'s loaded weapon 1 , that , in many ways , symbolise the biggest problem of contemporary american film industry - lack of originality and ideas . \\nbeing made as some kind of parody on lethal weapon series , this film pairs two l . a . policemen - jack colt ( emilio estevez ) , burn-out alcoholic cop on the edge , and wes luger ( samuel l . jackson ) , by-the-book policeman , days away from retirement . \\ntwo of them , following the murder of luger\\'s ex- partner , must confront evil general mortars ( william shatner ) , crime lord who is going to flood the market with cocaine stashed in wilderness girl cookies . \\nthe authors of this films ( whose director , gene quintano , worked on such projects like third and fourth sequel of police academy ) lacked any original idea before they undertook the projects , and that reflects in the lack plot , characters , and , even original lines . \\nthe plot , or what goes for the plot in this movie , is nothing more than a series of gags that make laugh of some popular films made in previous few years ( apart from lethal weapon series , this film \" borrows \" its female lead from basic instinct ) . \\nthe best gags , are , same as with many other similar movies , shown in the trailers . \\nthe rest simply doesn\\'t work . \\nonly those who used to watch a lot of hollywood products in that period would laugh . \\nothers would probably wince at the lameness of humour . \\nsome would be entertained by celebrity cameos that pop up every once in a while . \\nbut , at the end , spending hour and half in front of this disorganised mess of a movie is simply not worth the effort . \\nthe film was sometimes criticised for being the parody of a series that already had strong comic overtones . \\nthe authors of lethal weapon returned the favour by using the loaded weapon 1 joke in their fourth sequel . \\n',\n",
       "  b'a movie about divorce and custody in 1995 seems about as timely as a movie about mood rings . \\nfamily breakups have been an all too familiar part of the american landscape for nearly thirty years , and countless dramas have told stories of acrimonious court battles in hand-wringing detail . \\nstill , i can\\'t recall a comedy about the subject before bye bye love . \\nand after it , i still can\\'t . \\nbye bye love is rarely funny , more often a weak and melodramatic retread of common tv-movie fare . \\nonly a few moments which have nothing to do with the film\\'s main premise offer big laughs instead of cliched emotion . \\nbye bye love follows one weekend in the lives of three divorced fathers who get weekend custody of their children . \\ndave ( matthew modine ) , a father of two , is an inveterate womanizer having difficulty staying faithful to his latest girlfriend ; vic ( randy quaid ) is a foul-humored father of three about to go on a rare date ; donny ( paul reiser ) pines for his ex-wife and has trouble relating to his teenage daughter emma ( eliza dushku ) . \\nover the course of the weekend , the three men face various crises , including vic\\'s blind date from hell ( janeane garofolo ) and donny\\'s growing estrangement from emma . \\nthe three lead actors form a rather unlikely combo , and the quality of their performances is of widely varying quality . \\nrandy quaid is the best of the three , bitter without being irritating , gleefully spiteful without being frightening . \\nhis run-ins with is ex-wife ( lindsey crouse ) are a bit over-played , though , and his confrontation with a pompous radio psychologist ( rob reiner ) is gimmicky and implausible . \\nhe does get bye bye love\\'s best sub-plot , a hilarious dinner date with a gloriously demented janeane garofolo , and he does a great slow burn . \\npaul reiser really has only one character , his slightly befuddled , uptight nice guy \" mad about you \" persona , but he does it well . \\nas a personality , he is appealing , but as a character , he becomes pretty boring here . \\nmatthew modine , is , quite simply , terrible . \\nthis isn\\'t a performance good enough to be called mailed-in ; he even forgot to put a stamp on it . \\nmodine lacks any charm in an appallingly under-written role , looks bored most of the time , and gets stuck with a trite little speech about how it\\'s all his father\\'s fault he\\'s such a cad . \\ncarolco\\'s executives , whose entire future is resting on modine\\'s bankability for the upcoming cutthroat island , must be sweating buckets right now . \\nbye bye love basically comes off as a very confused movie , because it spends far too much of its time on the new relationships of its main characters instead of on the relationships between the fathers and their kids , making it just another \" dating in the 90s \" movie . \\nwhen the movie does deal with the children at all , it is to have one of them scream out an accusation and/or cry , perhaps to be resolved later by a sensitive talk and a hug , perhaps not . \\neven more confusing is a sub-plot featuring the late ed flanders as a widower who goes to work and a mcdonald\\'s and befriends a troubled youth . \\nit is a sad end to flanders\\' career , getting caught up in a truly annoying over-use of mcdonald\\'s as a location , a plot device and , apparently , a major advertiser . \\neven if bye bye love had decided to spend its time focusing exclusively on the parent-child relationships , it still would have been pretty difficult to pull off , because ultimately there is very little humor one can wring from family break-ups and their effects on children . \\nany way you slice it , it is a bad situation for kids , and the makers of bye bye love mostly go for the heartstrings when dealing with the single parenting issue . \\nit is left to the dads\\' romantic fumblings to probide what little humor there is , and it isn\\'t enough . \\nthere have been comparisons between bye bye love and parenthood , but parenthood was both genuinely funny and genuinely touching . \\nbye bye love is a genuine shame . \\n',\n",
       "  b\"seen may 19 , 1999 at 5 p . m . at the crossgates cinema 18 ( guilderland , n . y . ) , theater #1 , with my brother john for $8 . 50 . \\n[theater rating : * * * * : excellent seats , sound and picture] \\n ( critic's note : this review is the longest i've ever written and still only scratches the surface . \\ni'd recommend this be read only by those who have seen the film as a form of critical analysis . ) \\nas my friend and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of `the phantom menace' - how do i even write this review ? \\nnever mind the fact that i've been waiting for a new `star wars' movie since i was seven years old . \\nnever mind the fact everyone on the internet had already dissected and discussed the movie before it was even released . \\nnever mind that there's so much going on in this movie in terms of plot , action , special effects and long-term story that to analyze every aspect would take a lot of time and energy and still wouldn't cover everything . \\nand also like ted does in all of his reviews , i'll try to review this in a way different from my usual reviews and instead write as casually as possible as if i was talking directly to you , the reader . \\nbefore we can begin analyzing the specific aspects of the film , many of the most general and most significant factors must be considered ( to get the specifics of the film , skip this and the next four paragraphs ) . \\nas has been made obvious for the last several years , another trilogy of films will be produced to account for the [missing] initial three installments of the `star wars' series ( the first of the films was actually episode four , not one ) . \\ngeorge lucas , the creator of the series , has probably just assumed most people know the first-produced trilogy ( `star wars , ' `the empire strikes back' and `return of the jedi' ) is actually the second trilogy , chronologically . \\nin media interviews in the past he has explained why the movies were made out of order , but i can't recall his reasons . \\nwith this new film he as writer and director has also assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with the storylines and significant plot points of the first trilogy ( err . . . \\nsecond trilogy . . . \\nwell you know what i mean ) . \\nand in order for this review to be thorough many of those significant points must be mentioned which , unfortunately , may serve as spoilers so proceed with caution . \\n[critic's note #1 : it is one my personal policy not to intentionally analyze spoilers because i would like my reviews to be able to make sense to the reader both before and after viewing the film reviewed , but it would be nearly impossible to do the film justice here without breaking the rule . \\ncritic's note #2 : reviewing this film also breaks the universal critics' law of reviewing movies , which as roger ebert coined , `it's not what a movie is about , but how it is about it . ' \\nbecause so many outside factors come into play in the film's plot and significance as part of a trilogy , and just considering modern society , it again would be difficult , if not impossible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous story . ] \\nfirst of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it . \\nwe know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker , who will lead a successful revolution against him and his empire . \\nwe know obi-wan `ben' kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of `the force' in attempts to become a jedi knight , but would fail and thus anakin would fall to the `dark side . ' \\nwe also know something about `the force' itself , that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate and can be manipulated by those whose minds are expanded enough to believe in it and feel it ( the jedi ) . \\nwhat we don't know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy , which is most likely much longer and more complex than any government we have had here on earth . \\nto me , this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle , definite order to all the complexity . \\nalso , it seems that we're supposed to be familiar with a few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended . \\nmost notably , details regarding the emperor from `empire' and `jedi , ' and that he was once a senator and his last name is palpatine . \\nfor those who haven't kept up with all the `star wars' paraphernalia over the years , there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor ( or his voice at least ) . \\nwith `the phantom menace' being the first chapter of a long saga , one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid , including the history behind all the major factors of the series , especially `the force' and the jedi knights . \\nunfortunately , this film does more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be a history so long and detailed it could never be explained . \\ni didn't liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness . \\nif you're going to tell a story from the beginning - tell it from the beginning ( is it possible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes -1 through -3 to clarify the back story even further ? ) . \\nbut i digress . \\ni've said so much and yet i haven't even touched on the specifics of the film itself . \\nall these necessary `disclaiming' elements should go to show just how vast the story of the `star wars' series is and this individual film itself . \\nwhat we get here is a movie not unlike any of the other three we've come to know and love since the late 1970s . \\nits similarity to the other films helps to keep the spirit of the series familiar , but at the same time seems to be a flaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes rings of unoriginality . \\nthe basic story is rather sorted , complex and even confusing at times . \\nwe're told that an army known as `the trade federation' has set up a blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo . \\nwe're not given too many details to clarify the back story of what the federation is and what their purpose is , instead the film opts to get its story moving quickly . \\nwe're introduced to two jedi , the master qui-gon jinn ( neeson ) and his apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( mcgregor ) . \\nthe two are acting as ambassadors of some sort in hopes of ending the obvious hostility between the federation and the planet's queen , amidala ( portman ) . \\nthe leader of the federation , an alien called viceroy , is following the orders of a strange , mythical character - an older human man whose face and body are covered and shadowed by the black robe and hood he wears . \\nhe is referred to as lord sidious but considering his appearance , and especially that creepy evil voice of his , he is a obviously one of the most significant characters in the series . \\nsidious communicates to viceroy only through digital transmissions and never in person . \\nclearly his actual whereabouts are something he wants to keep secret because that would also reveal his identity ( which is never openly revealed in the film , but should be clear to most viewers . \\ni have a feeling we'll delve into his background in the next two films ) . \\nbut it doesn't take the film long to spring into action and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives and the film's story begins to move along . \\nthe film doesn't have one specific plot and works in the same manner as the other films in the series where as what we get is one mini-plot and adventure on top of another . \\nthere are so many of these mini-plots-within-plots in this film i would not describe them all because it is what gives the movie its hook . \\nthe other films have relied on this type of storytelling , but because of the limits of the technology at the time , the films' screenplays were also limiting . \\nthe sense of limitlessness here is what gives `the phantom menace' its unique traits . \\nas we already know , the film takes place at least a generation or two before the original `star wars' trilogy which means a lot of the background which was unclear and/or unexplained may be cleared up here as it is the beginning of the vast epic story . \\nand here the most significant storyline is that involving the discovery of 10-year-old anakin skywalker ( lloyd ) , by qui-gon jinn and his introduction to the jedi council . \\nto briefly summarize the story , jinn stumbles upon skywalker in an attempt to buy parts for queen amidala's spaceship which was damaged in efforts to free her from the federation . \\ntheir meeting on tatooine is mostly chance but of course jinn chalks it up to the will of the force . \\njinn can feel that skywalker has a great natural power in the force , and through another sub-plot involving a bet on skywalker in a fantastic race he will enter , more and more details of his significance begin to reveal themselves . \\nthis also provides for a new elaboration and explanation of the force which has never been mentioned before . \\nin fact , it seems to be something so important it is upsetting it has never been mentioned before . \\nthe element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force and transforms it into something more physical and scientific which is completely unnecessary . \\nby the film's third act all the major significant elements become tied together in a rather familiar execution of the plot . \\nit's funny how the reality of the `star wars' world seems so embedded in mythology , new age-like philosophy and religion and yet the solution to all the major conflicts in the series has been violence . \\nnot that this technique hasn't been used in movies and in real-life situations countless times throughout history . \\nand at least it's all in the spirit of the ultimate powers of good versus evil in a fun and exciting matter . \\nit does border of the cartoonish sometimes , but that's just the film appealing to our inner child , which is the basic reason the entire saga exists and has become such a big part of our modern society . \\n`the phantom menace' delivers exactly what you'd expect from a `star wars' film which is why it succeeds as well as it does but is always why it never truly achieves greatness . \\nso many things in the film we've seen before and done with more heart because the filmmakers concentrated just a bit more on story and character because they were limited . \\nbut this film is far from bad because it at least embraces the spirit of sheer fun at the movies . \\n\",\n",

       "  b'john cusack is the kind of actor who seems to effortlessly slide into his respective film roles . \\nso effortlessly that people tend to forget he\\'s there , much in the way people rarely recall many of the great character actors ( anyone who can put the name james rebhorn with that actor\\'s face is invited to treat themselves to a product from one of my sponsors ) . \\nexample : the other day my mother asked me ( the expert , of course ) if there were any movies out worth seeing , never mind that our tastes couldn\\'t be more divergent--- i\\'ll never forget the day she recommended that i go see a night at the roxbury for god sakes , and to be fair she was mightily pissed at me for telling her that go ! \\nwas a lot of fun ( which it is ) , so i didn\\'t see this as anything more than a futile attempt at conversation . \\ni muttered , with a little trepidation , that she might enjoy high fidelity . \\nshe responded with her usual query , \" whose in that one ? \" \\nthis is a question whose answer that seems to immediately conjure up the kind of movie you went to see . \\nif the reply is julia roberts you probably assume it was something wispy and light , a sylvester stallone movie and you picture a bloodbath with few words and much involuntary bicep flexing , and a woody allen movie means hyper articulate white people ( usually of the jewish faith ) fretting about in some upper east side palace . \\nanyway , when i answered \" john cusack \" , she replied with a rather stunned \" who ? \" , as if it was unreasonable for her to know whom i was referring to . \\nnow i know for a fact that my mother has seen several cusack movies , most recently being john malkovich and pushing tin , but i suppose it\\'s understandable that she would not recognize the name , after all , for most , names are tougher than faces . \\ni showed her a picture of cusack\\'s mug in the paper hoping for an \" oh - him , yes he\\'s quite good \" instead i got a \" no - i don\\'t know him \" . \\nat this point i was way beyond frustration into a realm of nose hair yanking anger ( yes , filmic ignorance is all it takes to get me into the nose hair pulling zone ) , till i realized something : i doubt that much of america would recognize cusack\\'s relatively bland visage , or even the name which is rather bland compared to the coolness of a brad pitt or tom cruise , one-syllable names that glide off the tongue with the velocity of a speeding car . \\ncu-sack . cu-sack - no , not quite as cool . \\ni\\'m sure that twenty years from now cusack will forever be referred to as \" the guy from ( add in the cusack film of your choice ) \" . \\nhe\\'s not a brand name , and his movies usually aren\\'t big moneymakers , but in his own unassuming way he\\'s kind of a genius . \\nwith his pleasant , common man looks , and charming semi-articulate blatherings he has become one of the most likeable romantic leading men of the 90\\'s . \\nfrom the sure thing to say anything cusack has merged the talents of early tom hanks and early jack lemmon . \\ndespite the fact that nearly every character he plays is a variation of the character before it ( the schlumpy every man ) , he\\'s a constantly enjoyable screen persona , like albert brooks or woody allen . \\nand he knows how to chose scripts , while the stephan baldwin\\'s and val kilmer\\'s seem to put them selves in everything ( the former actually had the insight to follow up oscar winner usual suspects with a pauly shore vehicle , and judging from his latest projects it looks like he still has yet to fire his agent ) , cusack generally picks rewarding projects ( save for the unwatchable hot pursuit , a 1988 film also featuring a young ben stiller ) . \\nhigh fidelity is his second collaboration with hit or miss english director stephan fears ( the grifters , the hi-lo country ) , and it\\'s a hit . \\nit was also co-written by cusack , and some of his collaborators on the terrific comedy , grosse point blank . \\nit\\'s not quite as entertaining or as funny as that film , but as it progresses in its meandering fashion , the movie cast something of a spell over me . \\nhigh fidelity begins as a hipster ode to the non-committal rob , a vinyl record store owner , who opens the film by breaking down the fourth wall with much abandon and educating us in his \" top 5 break ups list \" . \\nthis is something cusack does the entire film a la ferris bueller\\'s day off . \\nat first the talking-directly-into-the-camera-schtick had me vaguely annoyed , mostly because it reminded me so much of the film body shots which used a similar conceit , but it began to grow on me due almost entirely to cusack\\'s witty delivery . \\nhe\\'s the kind of guy we don\\'t mind talking directly to us . \\ngradually the film settles into a shampoo-like tragi-comic character study , of a guy who must confront himself and his personal failures in order to figure out the true person he is ( yes it\\'s all very existential ) . \\nthough that plot-line is mostly enjoyable , the thing i liked the most about the film is how much pleasure it offers in introducing us to minor characters , all of whom ( now this is really something ) are terrific enough to warrant their own films . \\nthe best of which is jack black ( of the very funny show tenacious d , a program that sadly went the way of bruce willis\\' hair ? ? ? unfortunately that annoying smirk remains ) , an ardent record store employee who bullies customers into buying exactly what he wants them to buy . \\nhe\\'s the kind of guy i\\'m sure we\\'ve all met before , a blowhard who thinks he\\'s always right and will do anything in his power ( be it yell , argue , insult ) to hoist his opinion onto others . \\nbut i like this guy , because of how black plays him . \\nthe actor is portly with a round baby face and crazy eyes , but despite his size he leaps to and fro like a manic speed freak ( which might be a bit of a redundant description , seeing as how all the speed freaks i know are manic ) . \\nhe\\'s the kind of supporting character who would be impossibly annoying comic relief in most other films . \\n ( look at what that hack jan de bont did to poor phillip seymour hoffman in twister ) . \\nbut fears and black never let that happen . \\nthe character , for all his shucking and jiving is steeped in reality . \\nhe\\'s over the top , but in a way we can all probably relate to . \\ncatherine zeta-jones , in her brief role , gives a vivid portrayal of a women completely enamored with her own \" charm \" . \\ntim robbins registers in an even tinier part as a new age-type , a character played entirely for cartoon yuks , but still manages to work its desired comic effect . \\nthe one exception in the acting department is a bit of a doozy , the main love interest played by danish actress iben hjejle ( mifune ) , who completely obliterates any trace of a danish accent , replacing it with a stilted american phonation . \\ni give her kudos for attempting such a contradictory role , but instead of being likeable , she comes across as rather robotic , and as such it\\'s hard to see why cusack\\'s character would be so obsessed with her especially when he has a beautiful , intelligent writer ( natasha gregson wagner ) potentially waiting in the wings . \\nthis reminded me of say anything , where the charming cusack was paired with the charmless ione skye , and in midnight in the garden of good and evil where the poor bastard had to put up with alison eastwood ( whose unbelievably more wooden then father , clint for those \" special people \" whose wheels turn a little slower ) . \\nin fact cusack is rarely paired up with a personality that matches his , though i\\'d bet that if laura and natasha switched roles , the result would be more effective . \\nhigh fidelity works almost entirely on the strength of its characters and performances . \\nfears\\' direction is somewhat stilted , and the script is sometimes a little too ( and this is a word i\\'m beginning to hate to use but alas i must ) quirky for its own good ( i think i\\'ll blame that on scott rosenberg , who judging from what he did with beautiful girls , con air , and things to do in denver while your dead , has his fingerprints all over the most irritating bits of this movie ) . \\nbut cusack really does deserve an award , for being so damn ? ? ? cusackian . \\ni\\'m afraid that his talents are so understated that he may have to wait till his hip needs replacing to be offered such an award worthy of his considerable talent . \\nhis character , rob ( whose sort of like an older , more bitter lloyd from say anything ) is funny and tragic without being pathetic , and that cusack can do all this , and still not imprint himself onto the minds of most audiences , is something of an achievement . \\n',\n",

       "  b\"one of the most popular subplots in the entire science fiction genre is time travel . \\nthat concept , although many purists doubt its scientific credentials , spawned many interesting novels , comic books and films in the last century . \\nhowever , the big grand-daddy of time travels , h . g . wells' novel the time machine , wasn't written with the intention to speculate about that concept or its consequences . \\nthe author , h . g . wells merely used it as a convenient way to express his socialist views and condemn the great social gap between the rich , idle capitalist class and impoverished labour . \\nwhatever intentions wells had , the future generations of readers were less impressed by his political messages . \\ninstead they were fascinated by the idea that the strange new worlds could be explored without traveling trough space . \\nthe novel became one of great classics of science fiction genre and it natural for filmmakers to use it as inspiration . \\nfirst of them was george pal , who in 1960 directed film which would , through the years , become genre classic of its own . \\nthe plot revolves about george ( rod taylor ) , victorian scientist who discovered the way to travel through the fourth dimension - time . \\nat the eve of the new 20th century , george gathers his friends in order to present them his invention - machine that would enable him to travel through time . \\nthey are skeptical , but that doesn't prevent george from carrying out his plan and traveling into the future . \\nat first , he travels slowly , seeing london as it changes through the years and three world wars . \\nfinally , after witnessing world war three , he travels far into the future , hoping that he would cease to witness wars and senseless destructions . \\nwhen he finally reaches year 802 , 701 ad , at first glance , new world looks like utopia - humanity consists of young , beautiful , but idle eloi , people who are fed , clothed and taken care of by unseen machines . \\nbut , weena ( yvette mimieux ) , eloi woman , tells george about another side of the coin - in the night , her people is preyed upon by morlocs , humanoid creatures from the underworld . \\nthe time machine became the cinematic classic for the very same reason the novel became the classic in science fiction literature - the fantastic concept was a brilliant way for the authors to talk about burning issues and fears of their respective times . \\nfor h . g . wells it was frightening threat of class struggle ; for george pal and his screenwriter david duncan , who produced the film in the worst days of the cold war , it was the constant and more imminent threat of nuclear holocaust , underlined with the negative references to war throughout the movie . \\neven the modern audience , which would be tempted to discard the film as old-fashioned , could find some values in its universal messages , fit for each era . \\ncompared with the genre films of today , the time machine is even better , and could serve as a good example how to make intelligent , thought-provoking films . \\nof course , since this is hollywood product after all , the time machine delivers such concepts in the form of classic adventure , sometimes sacrificing plausibility for the sake of attractiveness . \\nfor example , it is hard to imagine that someone would be able to understand perfect english million years in future ; same is with morlocs degenerating into mutant monsters , while eloi remain undistinguished from the people of today . \\nsome of the final scenes , that turn victorian scientist into an action superhero , are also rather unconvincing . \\nbut , on the other hand , the film is very well directed , cleverly paced and the special effects , although definitely old-fashioned , are more than adequate for this kind of picture . \\nthe acting is good , with rod taylor in one of his most remembered roles , while in the same time alan young brings rather memorable performance as george's trusted friend filby . \\nyvette mimieux , who plays weena , on the other hand , would be remembered more by her looks than by the complexity of her role . \\nhowever , despite all those flaws , the time machine is a very good piece of cinema , something that connoisseurs of quality science-fiction films sorely miss these days . \\n\",\n",

\\nin a way , star wars is so much a part of our cultural heritage that it feels silly and almost artificial to try to summarize it . \\nit's a story about a young man's coming of age , a fight for freedom against an oppressive empire , a tale of swashbuckling and derring-do the likes of which haven't been seen on the silver screen in decades , strange new worlds with strange alien creatures and weird surprises around every turn , and the yearning within each of us to realize our dreams and make a difference in the world . \\nit's high adventure , incredible special effects , and . . . well , it's just an _experience_ . \\nsomething about this movie sparked the imagination of a generation . . . and \\nit's about to do so again . \\nthis new release of star wars comes as no surprise to many of the film's devoted fans , who have been trading rumors and bits of information about it for quite some time now . \\ninterviews , trailers , leaks from within lucasfilm . . . all of these have been collected , collated , and placed on webpages for people to see ( pages such as http : //www . islandnet . com/~corona/films/details/sw4 . html \\nor , my personal favorite , http : //leopard . cs . latrobe . edu . au/~koukoula/ \\n ) . \\npictures of before and after have been placed side by side . . . even \\nmonths before the movies were released , fans were making comparisons . \\nin some cases , the changes were nothing less than phenomenal , and this can be seen from the comparison shots even before you go into the movie theater . \\nthe digital matte effects that were little more than a toy in forrest gump are put to excellent use here , unnoticeably sprucing up scenes that that george lucas was unsatisfied with in the original . \\nfor instance , in my personal favorite example , the ancient temple on yavin that was formerly a flat stone edifice now has deep , moss-covered carvings and etchings . \\nand mos eisley spaceport is now a bustling , booming city , with more surprises and things going on in the background than you can notice on the first viewing . \\nall the starships and fighters are now computer-animated , getting rid of glitches and artifacts of the special effects processes used when the film was originally made--and they look _fantastic_ . \\nfour and a half minutes of new or missing footage have been added , including a scene with jabba the hutt that had originally been shelved because the state of special effects in 1977 simply couldn't do it justice . \\nhowever , much of the ten million dollars that was spent on the star wars special edition restoration went into restoring the quality of the film itself . \\nthe negatives , badly damaged by the ravages of time , were brightened and returned to their original splendor . \\nthe audio tracks were remixed and reprocessed , with reworked sound effects by effects maven ben burtt , into glorious , booming , theater-shaking full-thx dolby digital stereo . \\nand _that_ , more than the added scenes or new special effects , is where the real value of this new version lies . \\nit's really true what they say in the commercials : star wars loses _so much_ on the small screen . \\neven letterboxing doesn't make up for the decrease in size and definition . \\nin regard to the star wars special edition , and to the other two films of the trilogy which have yet to be released , i'll make this final recommendation : go and see it . \\ngo and see it more than once . . . it \\nmay be another twenty years before it comes back to the big screen after it's gone this time . \\ntake along the youngsters who've never had the big-screen star wars experience--you'll enjoy seeing it through their eyes as much as they will enjoy it for the first time . \\nthere's magic in this movie--special edition or no , there can be no denying that it's still star wars , and still has the power to thrill and enthrall children of all ages , from four to four hundred . \\nlet's all return to that time long ago , and that galaxy far , far away . . . \\n\",\n",
       "  b'cinematically speaking , gordon parks\\' original 1971 _shaft_ is not a great film . \\na bit slow at times and more than a little rough around the edges as it builds to its climactic explosion of violent action , this spirited but formulaic yarn that initially brought ernest tidyman\\'s \" black private dick that\\'s a sex machine to all the chicks \" to the big screen hardly qualifies as groundbreaking filmmaking . \\nyet nearly 30 years after its original release--and long after the genre it spawned , \" blaxploitation , \" died with that decade--the 1971 _shaft_ remains an extremely entertaining watch , never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness . \\nthe reason for this is the same one that explains the film\\'s connection with moviegoers far beyond the target african-american audience : the title character of john shaft . \\nwhile the fact that the strong , smart , virile , and superbly suave shaft is black is the primary factor for his historical and cultural significance , his broad-based appeal stems from an idea that transcends race : he is comfortable , confident , and proud about who he is , and anyone who had a problem with that could simply kiss his ass . \\nthis fact also explains why john singleton\\'s y2g revival of john shaft is as enjoyable as it is . \\nmuch like the film that started the franchise , this _shaft_\\'s plot doesn\\'t score points in the originality department , but the energy level and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard crime thrillers . \\ncontrary to what has been reported over the past few months , this _shaft_ is not a remake of the original film , but more of a sequel/spinoff . \\nthe star audiences know and love from the original film and its first two sequels ( 1972\\'s _shaft\\'s_big_score ! _ and 1973\\'s _shaft_in_africa_ ) , richard roundtree , once again plays john shaft , who still runs a private investigation firm in new york city . \\nhowever , the focus of the film lies on his same-named nephew ( samuel l . jackson ) , who , as the film begins , is a cop whose take-no-crap demeanor constantly leaves him at odds with his superiors . \\nwhen a privileged young man named walter wade jr . ( christian bale ) accused of a brutal , racially-motivated murder is allowed to be released on bail , a disgusted shaft leaves the force and decides to take matters into his own hands as a p . i . \\nbut that\\'s easier said than done , for also standing in the way of shaft and his way of justice is peoples hernandez ( jeffrey wright ) , a dominican gangster who is hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri ( toni collette ) , the only eyewitness to his crime . \\npeoples--or , rather , wright is also the big obstacle in jackson\\'s way toward commanding this film . \\npeoples is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time , and wright is insanely funny during these stages . \\nhowever , he isn\\'t so funny as to make the character come off as goofy and buffoonish , and peoples\\' eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless and believable ( which probably would not have been the case had he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo , who bowed out before filming ) . \\nit\\'s no easy task to steal a film from the jackson ( who is his usual captivating , charismatic self here ) , but that\\'s exactly what wright does--and makes it seem effortless . \\nthen again , with such a talented ensemble surrounding him , it is not too surprising that jackson\\'s impressive star turn doesn\\'t quite tower over the rest ; he is strongly complemented not only by wright but all his other co-stars . \\nbale has already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in _american_psycho_ , so it only follows that his performance as a similar , less exaggerated character would be spot-on . \\ncollette lends the film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight as the frightened , conflicted diane . \\nbusta rhymes brings some good laughs as shaft\\'s sidekick rasaan . \\nregistering not as strongly--but through no fault of their own--are vanessa williams ( as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez ) and a dismayingly underused roundtree ; they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price , singleton , and shane salerno . \\n ( jackson also has little to \" do \" in a sense ; some throwaway footage during the opening credits aside , his shaft doesn\\'t even have one sex scene . ) \\nthat singleton once again proves his ability with actors is an especially good thing since he\\'s not really an action director . \\nthis is not to say that he does a bad job with the numerous gunfights and the requisite foot and car chases . \\nthey move well ( as does the film as a whole ) and are reasonably exciting ; it\\'s just that there\\'s nothing terribly inventive about them . \\nthese set pieces are functional in the way the script is : they work well enough , but they\\'re unsurprising and conventional . \\nbut if there\\'s anything that a _shaft_ movie does well , it\\'s make the familiar look cool--and this _shaft_ keeps that tradition alive . \\nfrom the slick title sequence--scored , of course , to isaac hayes\\' ever-infectious oscar-winning theme song , which singleton wisely sprinkles throughout the film--on , the film looks great and easily sweeps the viewer into its world with its energetic bravado . \\neven a common visual trick such as employing fancy wipes for scene transitions not only feels unforced , it feels necessary . \\nstyle doesn\\'t exactly make for a great film , but when it comes to _shaft_ , that\\'s of little consequence . \\nwhat matters above all else is having a good time , and the latest _shaft_ should be just the first of many fun rides to be had with this bad mutha--shut your mouth . \\n',\n",

\\nbecause there is more . \\nmuch , much more . \\nand this is a movie that , without credits , is little over 90 minutes and feels only like an hour . \\n \" the whole nine yards \" is an ultimately unsatisfying and empty-headed excursion into well-worn terrain already set by far superior pictures . \\nhow the cast , most of which are respectable actors , got caught up in such a cliched , deficient film remains a mystery , unless they thought it might aspire to match the congenial screwball zaniness of director lynn\\'s 1985 comedy classic , \" clue : the movie . \" \\ngoing into the theater , preliminary comparisons between the two movies were unavoidable , but by the twenty-minute mark , when i had chuckled once and laughed nary a single time , it was clear this production was in serious trouble . \\nsince the entire running time depends on the mechanisms of the plot , and the screenplay , inauspiciously written by mitchell kapner , collapses with every failing \" comedy \" bit , the film is an inevitable dead zone in the way of substance and , frequently , entertainment value . \\n \" the whole nine yards \" is neither facetious nor , aside from the subplot about jill\\'s shocking eagerness to become a professional hitwoman , inventive , and more often than not , just lies there , the film spinning drearily around and around in the projector , but never igniting any sort of spark . \\na few select actors do what they can with the material , while others make no impact at all . \\non the mediocre side are actually those playing the two central characters : matthew perry and bruce willis . \\nperry , innocuously enjoyable on tv\\'s \" friends , \" plays the same exact sitcom-style character in all of his movies ( from 1997\\'s \" fools rush in \" to 1999\\'s \" three to tango \" ) , and it has become a crushing bore . \\nmeanwhile , willis makes next to no impression , and because of the limited guise of his jimmy \" the tulip \" tudeski , oftentimes disappears into the background . \\ntheir three female counterparts fare noticeably better . \\nbest of all is natasha henstridge , far more radiant than in the exploitative \" species \" movies , who adds unanticipated depth and emotion to cynthia . \\nhenstridge has the talent , for sure , to break out of these countless throwaway roles , but first she must fire her agent . \\namanda peet has a lot of fun as the quirkily straightforward and giddy jill , and seems to know more about the art of comedic payoff than even perry who , thus far , has strived on a career based solely on comedy . \\nit is too bad , then , that peet is unnecessarily asked to disrobe in a climactic scene , with the obvious sole purpose being to show off her breasts . \\nfinally , rosanna arquette is awful as sophie , but something tells me that was her purpose , and her clear overacting only aids in brightening up her limited screen time . \\nalso popping up is michael clarke duncan , fresh off an oscar nomination for his role in \" the green mile , \" as jimmy\\'s largely built friend and fellow killer , frankie figs . \\nwhen \" the whole nine yards \" eventually sputters to its underwhelming conclusion , one is left pondering how such a film ever got greenlit . \\na great deal of movies of this type have been made in the past , and this one is nothing but a duplication of better films , so what was the point ?

       "  b'it should have been a classic . \\na great cast of respected supporting actors . \\nan interesting premise of loser comic book characters . \\nhowever , \" mystery men \" proved to be one of the great disappointments of 1999 . \\nthe jokes were bland and hackneyed from talents who have previously made audiences laugh with their unique rituals . \\nthe number of cliches and shallow characters made the film difficult to sit through seriously hurting its attempt of having a fast paced premise . \\nthe script tried to deliver a series of small jokes throughout the film but without a big laugh-out-loud joke and mediocre small jokes , it failed miserably at being entertaining at all . \\nthe jokes were not funny for a number of reasons . \\nthey had been used a number of times before in previous films , the best ones , which were mediocre to begin with , were ruined in the trailer , and the expectation of laughing at clever , unique gags from clever unique comedians when there were none to laugh at greatly damaged the film . \\n \" mystery men \" might have worked if it was an ensemble cast of newcomers trying to break into the business . \\nbut with veterans doing this kind of junk , it really questioned whether their other work was as funny as originally thought . \\nthankfully most actors in this movie will appear in five other movies before the new year arrives to help viewers forget this little movie . \\nthe film follows a band of wannabe superheroes living in a wannabe gotham city who are ridiculed by their fellow citizens and villains because of their clumsiness and failure to save they day and capture the bad guy . \\nthe fact is these pathetic losers are not needed because their city already has a successful superhero , captain amazing , who has recently captured every evil-doer in the city . \\ncaptain amazing ( played terribly by an uninspired greg kinnear ) , because of his success in the past , is worried that he will lose popularity . \\nafter freeing one of the most notorious bad guys in the city ( geoffrey rush , overacting just a bit too much ) to keep himself busy , things get out of hand when captain amazing is captured . \\nit is up to the wannabe superheroes to save the day . \\nby the time this section of the plot is finished , the interest for what happens ( if you haven\\'t already figured it out ) is very low . \\nthere are very few scenes which catch the viewers complete attention . \\nthe first scene in the film , which shows the wannabes trying to save the day , feels like it was seriously edited down . \\nright when it was beginning to become slightly funny seeing these actors get humiliated at an old folk\\'s home by some masked goons , captain amazing comes in and saves the day ? or ruins the movie . \\ninstead of editing this scene , more editing should have been done in areas such as the unnecessary romance between mr . furious ( ben stiller ) and monica , a waitress ( claire forlani ) or the vast majority of the film , which is the heroes talking at a coffee table about how their day was . \\na simple rule : more silly action is needed in order to make a silly action movie work . \\nanother major problem with \" mystery men \" is that every actor in it seemed very uncomfortable and consequently gave terrible performances . \\nthe film depended on its cast to work fluently together , like a bunch of old friends working together in an amiable reunion . \\nhowever , most characters seemed like they did not even want to be in this film or at least the script made it seem this way . \\nto pull one of the actors in this film randomly out of a hat , paul reubens , who disappeared from acting to everyone\\'s joy , returns here leaving very little to be impressed about . \\nas a wannabe who uses flatulence for a weapon , all of his jokes must therefore be fart jokes . \\nfart jokes that have all been heard before and will inevitably be heard again in future films thanks to the success of \" american pie \" and \" there\\'s something about mary . \" \\n \" mystery men \" drags on towards the end to a point where anything else in the world is more entertaining . \\nanyone with a brain knows each one of the heroes is going to be successful at their talent in the end and each one is going to contribute in a helpful way . \\nso why continue to watch ? \\nthis film is far from a worthy guilty pleasure . \\n \" mystery men \" indeed does this and every time a character succeeds another one congratulates him and says \" i knew you could do it ! \" \\n \" mystery men \" fails in every category it attempts to pass . \\nwhat makes this film so bad is that it had the potential to be wonderful and unforgettable . \\nterrible acting , terrible script , and a terrible waste of time changes opinions about all of these actors . \\n \" i\\'m unpredictable ! \" \\nan overexcited ben stiller shouts out . \\nno ben , you\\'re the complete opposite . \\n',\n",
       "  b'some critics , including siskel & ebert , are on the record stating that martin scorsese\\'s raging bull , the story of boxer jake la motta , is the best film of the \\'80s . \\nsince there are still a number of \\'80s films that i haven\\'t seen , i don\\'t feel qualified to make such a judgment , but i\\'ll say this without hesitation : raging bull is a great motion picture , and i would be surprised if more than a handful of films released between january 1 , 1980 and december 31 , 1989 come close to its level . \\nbio-pics often fall into one of two categories : overblown hero- worship or a dry , dull textbook account . \\nit\\'s rare that a movie with the moniker \" based on the life of ? \" comes across as anything more than sporadically energetic and marginally entertaining . \\nraging bull is the perfect counterexample , and a brilliant argument for film makers to continue to work in this genre . \\nthe picture takes the life of boxer jake la motta , a middleweight icon from the \\'40s and \\'50s , and develops one of the most compelling character studies ever to reach the big screen . \\nfor all 129 minutes , director martin scorsese and actor robert de niro ( in the title role ) have us mesmerized by this individual who is by turns sympathetic , sad , and horrifying . \\nhistorically , raging bull is said to be mostly accurately , with the lion\\'s share of the details culled from la motta\\'s own autobiography ( which was co-written with joseph carter and peter savage ) . \\nhowever , although la motta is credited as the movie\\'s \" consultant , \" he was reportedly unhappy with the final result , because it portrays him as nothing short of an uncouth , insensitive lout . \\nthe la motta of the movie is a man of extreme appetites who is driven by base , bestial impulses ? paranoia , jealousy , and blind rage . \\nsex and violence are inextricably linked . \\nthe title is apt ? la motta is a raging bull . \\nin the ring , he is a terror , not just beating his opponents , but destroying them . \\noutside of it , he is no less vicious or more easily controlled . \\nthe two people who spar with him on life\\'s canvas are his wife , vicki ( cathy moriarty ) , and his brother/manager , joey ( joe pesci ) . \\nthese are the two who mean the most to jake , and who , as a result of his inability to trust himself or others , he loses . \\nhe beats vicki mercilessly because he suspects her of infidelity , and , when he inaccurately believes that his brother betrayed him , his lets loose with an explosion of violence . \\nraging bull opens in 1941 when la motta , an up-and-coming fighter , is battling his way into the upper echelon of the middleweight class . \\nover the years , he wins several key bouts , including one against his arch-rival , sugar ray robinson ( johnny barnes ) , but his unwillingness to capitulate with the local godfather keeps him from an opportunity to participate in a championship match . \\nmeanwhile , away from the ring , la motta falls in love with 15-year old vicki , who he marries after discarding his shrewish first wife . \\nvicki becomes jake\\'s greatest prize ( a wife , in his view , is not a companion , but a possession ) and the source of his most extreme pain . \\nhis own insecurity is so great that he cannot accept that a woman as beautiful as vicki could be faithful to him . \\nhence , he is constantly haunted by a belief that she is sleeping with someone else ? perhaps even his brother . \\n ( this leads to the famous line parodied in waiting for guffman and elsewhere : \" are you f * * king my wife ? ? ? \" ) \\nin the late \\'40s , la motta gets his first shot at a championship fight , but with one huge condition : he must take a fall . \\nhe does it so badly that an investigation is launched and he is almost thrown out of boxing . \\ntwo years later , he wins the championship , only to lose it in a subsequent bout to sugar ray . \\nby the late \\'50s and early \\'60s , when the film ends , jake has become a pathetic figure ? a broke , overweight loser who has spent time in jail for corrupting the morals of a minor , has lost his wife and children , and is trying to earn a few bucks by doing a cheap standup routine . \\nraging bull is the other side of rocky . \\nsylvester stallone\\'s tale of boxing triumph was released to great critical acclaim in 1976 . \\nit won the 1977 best picture oscar , and a sequel arrived in theaters before raging bull went into production . \\nbut , where rocky romanticizes boxing , raging bull takes a cold , unflinching look at the violence both inside and outside of the ring . \\nwhile scorsese\\'s primary aim is to present a riveting deconstruction of la motta the man , he never backs away from showing the seedy , ugly underside of a sport where gambling , greed , and organized crime force fighters to throw matches to continue working . \\nrocky shows boxing at its noblest ; raging bull shows it at its most diseased . \\nthere\\'s little i can say here that hasn\\'t already said about de niro\\'s performance . \\nin a career that has included many fine roles , this is his most outstanding . \\nthe level of intensity de niro brings to la motta is unwavering . \\nand , although there\\'s a lot of travis bickle ( de niro\\'s character in taxi driver ) in la motta , scorsese and de niro go to great lengths to make sure that , if we never fully sympathize with him , at least we understand the forces that drive him . \\nthis is a complete characterization and a perfect example of acting . \\nas the younger jake , de niro is trim and fit . \\nas the fat , older man , de niro gained 50 pounds and turned his body into a grotesque parody of its normal form . \\nhow many actors would go that far ? \\nthe best oscar statue is only one testimony to the lasting power of the performance . \\ncathy moriarty and joe pesci both earned nominations for their supporting work ( although neither won ) . \\ntheir portrayals have the same raw energy that infuses de niro\\'s . \\npesci , who has basically re-created the same personality in two other scorsese films ( goodfellas and casino ) , presents joey as a slightly more intelligent version of his brother . \\nthe misogyny and violence are still there , only better concealed . \\nbut , when joey snaps , as he does in one scene where he pounds on a mobster ( frank vincent ) , it\\'s startling to behold . \\nmoriarty , on the other hand , must play the temptress with virginal qualities ? the only kind of woman who would ensnare jake . \\nlater , she\\'s called upon to portray the battered wife and mother whose love has turned into fear . \\nscorsese and cinematographer michael chapman elected to shoot the bulk of raging bull in black-and-white ( a few \" home movie \" segments are in color ) . \\nthe choice is perfect for the movie , giving raging bull a unique look in an era when a black-and-white approach is almost unheard of . \\n ( one important recent exception , schindler\\'s list , eschewed color for some of the same reasons that raging bull did . ) \\nin black-and-white ( especially considering scorsese\\'s choice of shots and use of slow motion ) , the violence is stark and disturbing . \\nthere\\'s no room for romanticism in the ring with inky black blood staining the canvas . \\nduring fight sequences , the director also uses a number of point-of-view shots designed to show the world , however briefly , from la motta\\'s perspective . \\nscorsese could have chosen to end the film with la motta\\'s loss to sugar ray , where he surrendered his middleweight crown . \\nafter that , his career was all downhill . \\nyet the director allows the film to run for thirty minutes after this pivotal moment , stretching more than a decade into la motta\\'s future . \\nthe reason is obvious : scorsese isn\\'t as interested in boxing as he is in the character . \\nfollowing his retirement , la motta is still as violent and volatile as ever , but he has lost the arena in which he can legally unleash those tendencies . \\nwe see the results of this beast let loose on society and how the consequences of his actions reduce him to a parody of his former self . \\nwho cannot feel a surge of pity for la motta as he quietly recites marlon brando\\'s speech from on the waterfront ? \\n ( \" i coulda been a contenda . \" ) \\nperhaps raging bull is indeed the best film of the \\'80s . \\nand , if not , it\\'s certainly perilously close to the zenith . \\n',\n",

       "  b'i can\\'t recall a previous film experience where the fairly good time i was having turned as sour as quickly as it did during feeling minnesota . \\nfor forty minutes or so , i was lured into a loopy if occasionally over-wrought romantic comedy , and i was even giving keanu reeves the benefit of the doubt . \\nthen , rather suddenly , i was clubbed over the head with a nasty bit of violence ; shortly thereafter , i was whacked in the gut by another . \\nfeeling minnesota is a film that made me feel violated , as though i had trusted writer-director steven baigelman to bring me a cool glass of water and instead he threw acid in my face . \\nfeeling minnesota tells the story of a topless dancer named freddie ( cameron diaz ) who finds herself in deep trouble when her boss red ( delroy lindo ) suspects her of stealing from him . \\nred\\'s punishment is to force freddie to marry his bookkeeper , sam clayton ( vincent d\\'onofrio ) , who is far from the man of freddie\\'s dreams . \\nenter jjaks ( keanu reeves ) , sam\\'s estranged younger brother , who arrives at the wedding just in time to catch freddie\\'s eye and have sex with her in the bathroom . \\nunited in their mutual attraction and their mutual loathing of sam , jjaks and freddie take off together , but sam isn\\'t ready to let them go without a fight . \\nfreddie , meanwhile , isn\\'t ready to let sam\\'s money go without a fight , and thus begins a series of violent confrontations . \\nthere is both style and substance to the beginning of feeling minnesota , as baigelman opens with an effective montage showing jjaks and sam\\'s intense sibling rivalry as boys , and their mother ( tuesday weld ) sending jjaks away to live with his father . \\nit does a great job of setting up jjaks\\' unstable life , a life which has landed him in trouble for petty crimes and always trying to please his family ; reeves\\' wounded look is just right for jjaks . \\nthe wedding sequence includes a number of nice moments , most notably the aforementioned bathroom scene in which a simple question is given a very funny spin . \\nmost important , baigelman begins to establish the connection between freddie and jjaks with humor and economy , as in a scene where they both spontaneously begin singing along to the replacements\\' \" i will dare \" on the car radio . \\nyou would have every reason to expect that relationships -- both familial and romantic -- would be the focal point of feeling minnesota . \\nunfortunately , you would be dead wrong . \\ni suppose i should have expected daisies and valentines after an early scene in which red threatens freddie as she tries to avoid the wedding , but i certainly didn\\'t expect what i got . \\nwhat i got was yet another in a long line of recent films trying to ride the tarantino wave by mixing gags and brutality , or rather creating gags about brutality . \\nsuddenly , the story of romantic entanglements and family conflict becomes a story about a corpse , and everything which had come before degenerates so completely that virtually nothing is recognizable . \\nthe sibling rivalry not only becomes little more than an excuse for one round of beatings after another , but there is no consistency to the characterizations . \\nvincent d\\'onofrio turns in a manic performance as sam , whose jealousy , competitiveness and apparent sense of inferiority seem far more in keeping with what we know about jjaks , while reeves turns into a framed hero too reminiscent of chain reaction , and both of them spend most of the second half of the film screaming and covered in blood . \\nthere are films which have managed to employ a radical shift in tone successfully ( jonathan demme\\'s something wild and neil jordan\\'s the crying game come to mind ) , but they didn\\'t try to draw an audience with the promise of relatively innocuous entertainment . \\ni don\\'t want to dismiss baigelman\\'s successes out of hand -- he gets a fun performance out of dan aykroyd as a crooked cop , and some well-crafted comic moments -- and it is not his fault that fine line has chosen to promote feeling minnesota as a light-hearted caper . \\nit _is_ his fault that he violates his own characters for the sake of shock value , and that he can\\'t make his two halves into a whole . \\nfeeling minnesota left me feeling used , and there\\'s not much funny about that . \\n',\n",

the couple on the outside , but for leila , life isn\\'t quite as sweet . \\nearlier , on that very same day , leila had gone to see her physician , and has ultimately discovered that she holds very little chance of ever conceiving a child . \\nwhen all of the conditions are ruled out , and leila passes up the possibility of adoption , reza firmly and lovingly tells her that he married her , and doesn\\'t care at all about having children . \\nnonetheless , leila is ashamed that she will never be able to give him a baby , which is the societal norm , and her self-esteem is not helped at all by her domineering mother-in-law ( jamileh sheikhi ) , whose hopes to carry on the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news ( reza is her only son ) . \\nbluntly explaining to leila that reza has always wished for children and , in a country where polygamy is an accepted tradition , she suggests that he take a second wife to bear a child with . \\nleila hesitantly agrees , and while she and reza are able to shallowly laugh afterwards about the hopeful womens\\' inadequacies , reza finally does meet a woman whom he claims to like , even though he refuses to go through with the marriage if leila doesn\\'t give her full blessing . \\nthere are no easy answers to be found within \" leila , \" a film that thoughtfully examines the central character\\'s unfortunate plight , as well as the inner workings of leila herself , told through matter-of-fact narration . \\nalmost completely taken over by her own shame , she has no option but to agree to her forceful mother-in-law\\'s requests , even though she is unsure of how she will react if reza really does end up marrying another woman . \\nmaybe because \" leila \" is from iran , the film will unquestionably be shocking for american audiences , since the concept of polygamy is looked upon by the characters as a more or less everyday occurrence . \\nleila , however , is unable to come to terms with the idea quite as easily , but feels it is her duty to make her husband happy , no matter what the circumstances . \\none of the strongest aspects of the film is in its portrayal of the relationship between leila and reza , who married only three months after their first meeting , but obviously love each other very deeply . \\nit is this relationship that is the key ingredient to making what follows the opening scenes all the more powerful , and director mehrjui has succeeded just about as well as possible . \\nalthough seemingly unimportant at first glance , an early sequence where leila and reza are eating dinner and both are laughing , nearly uncontrollably , actually is one of the most vital moments in the first half , as it unmistakably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another . \\nditto for another scene in which reza gives leila a large stuffed animal for her birthday , and then reveals a beautiful necklace he has also gotten her . \\nthese \" small \" moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn , outraging sequences in the latter half , in which reza drops leila off at the side of a busy road , and then zooms off to go on a date with another woman . \\nleft there to ponder her quickly diminishing marriage , foolishly unbeknownst to reza , leila prays each time that the date will not go well , so she will be able to keep her husband to herself for a little while longer . \\nrefusing to stay over at her parent\\'s house , the film inevitably leads up to the second wedding night between reza and another woman , and in a sequence of extraordinary sorrow and potency , leila finds her whole being emotionally torn apart , as she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom as the marriage proceedings are going on down below . \\ndespite her initial agreement to such a thing , leila realizes how much she has been betrayed by reza , whom she believed cared for her as much as she did of him . \\nsure , the whole second marriage was his mother\\'s idea , but if he really did believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any children , then he could have still easily backed out , couldn\\'t he ? \\nin the pivotal role of leila , who appears in every scene , leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable , injecting her character with an equal measure of startling strength , unavoidable vulnerability , and utter despair . \\nunlike most american films , in which everything always has to be spelled out for audiences , hatami says much more with just an elusive expression on her face than could possibly have been conveyed by words . \\nevery bit a perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa , as reza , a man who , i believe , does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife , but is too naive to realize what he will be doing to leila if he marries someone else . \\nfor all of its strong aspects , \" leila \" isn\\'t a perfect film . \\non a technical level , i found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistakes within the subtitles that need to be fixed . \\nand concerning the plot developments , the final five minutes ring false when compared with everything that has come before . \\nmehrjui\\'s decision to use an extremely stylized approach to the ending was the wrong choice , particularly in his almost comedic way of wrapping up the character of the spiteful mother-in-law , played memorably by jamileh sheikhi . \\ndespite these minor missteps , \" leila \" is an important motion picture that should definately be sought out upon its limited may 16 release at new york\\'s cinema village , and then on may 21 in la . \\nthe thought-provoking questions that the film deals with is balanced evenly with its uneasy morales , and when the climax arrives , leila\\'s self-worth is startlingly stripped away to reveal a victim led into complete devastation , to which there is no return . \\nit\\'s difficult to not consider how leila\\'s culminating interior demise could have been so simply avoided , had the other characters taken a second out of their own selfish lives to consider what leila , the major pawn in the unforgivable scheme , was going through . \\n',\n",
       "  b\"this movie was one of the first american films done by director paul verhoeven . \\nhe has done films since then such as basic instict and starship troopers . \\nall of his movies have one main thing in common- they don't skimp on the violence . \\nin a verhoeven movie a guy doesn't get shot once in the chest- he gets shot many times all over the body . \\nrobocop takes place in detroit in the future . \\nthings are pretty bleak . \\nthe company ocp rules the city with an iron fist and is moving in on running the police force . \\npeter weller plays a cop who goes on a mission with his partner , nancy allen . \\npeter weller goes in an empty room alone and gets killed . \\nmeanwhile ocp has a failed demonstration of a ed-209 model robot crime fighter . \\nsomeone comes up with the idea of having a cyborg robocop so they use any parts worth scalvaging from peter weller and make him into the robocop the movie is titled after . \\nthe plot of this movie generally runs at a decent pace . \\nit drags a bit towards the end with robocop wanting to finish everybody off , but plot twists keep it exciting . \\nthe acting is bad from weller when he is human , but very good when he is robocop . \\nnancy allen does a decent job . \\nthis movie doesn't leave itself open for a sequel exactly . \\nbut they made one anyway . \\nenter . . . \\nrobocop 2 starring : peter weller and nancy allen directed by : irvin kershner \\ndetroit is in a more bleak state than it was in the first film . \\nocp is trying to develop an improved 'robocop 2' that will be more than a match for criminals . \\nmost of the police force is on strike due to ocp taking it over , leaving robocop to be the police force in the city . \\nthis film is pretty bizaare . \\nit has a 13 year-old drug-lord who curses as much as eddie murphy , even more violence than the original , and some more humor . \\nthe plot of this movie is pretty large , almost too much so . \\nthere are three or four plot lines weaving around that don't really match up . \\nthe effects are still decent though . \\nthis sequel isn't more of the same really , just a darker version robocop dealing more with drugs than with armed criminals . \\nif you liked the first one , watch this . \\nbut be dissapointed . \\nso later comes . . . \\nrobocop 3 starring nancy allen and robert john burke \\nocp is now owned by a large japanese company . \\nrobocop joins a band of rebels to counter-attack the evil empire , i mean ocp . \\nthe japanese send a cyborg-ninja to deal with robocop . \\namong other things . . . \\nthis movie is easier to follow than the last one . \\nwhich means the plot isn't quite as crowded . \\nthis movie isn't anything special though . \\njust more of robocop blasting things up in a more kid-friendly way . \\nreally not reccomended . \\n\",\n",
       "  b'as much as i wanted to like this film as i went into it , the more pleased i was when i left . \\nfirst , getting through all the usual lines of newspaper glitz : \" if you liked scream , you\\'ll love wild things ! \" \\n \" campbell gives a stunning performance ! \" \\n \" this twisty plot will have you dazzled for days ! \" \\n ( oh yeah , the day a newspaper uses these is the day neve campbell falls in love with me ) \\nnow , onto more serious stuff ( and with this film , i mean that in nearly a sarcastic way ) . \\nwild things has single-handedly broken down the rules surrounding the r rating from the mpaa . \\ni\\'m not saying that in a bad way , but when you see this film , you may be shocked by what you see . \\nhowever , perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the film\\'s charming cast and tricky plot , that they let the film slide with an r rating . \\nbeing mormon , i\\'m bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film . \\ntrouble is , i have already seen it . \\nand i like it ! \\nwild things is a film noir of the 90s , filled with 40s sensibilities , and yet breaking the rules and modern-day taboos of 90s culture . \\nthe style in which it is filmed is rich in color . \\nthe actors are all gorgeous people , seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into this film . \\nsure , it\\'s all too good to be true , but ain\\'t it fun to watch ? \\nwhen movies like this come along ( sort of a better version of basic instinct ) there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it . \\nthere will be people who don\\'t want to admit liking what they see , but i tell you , most anyone who sees this will like it . \\nwild things begins at blue bay high school , the one high school in the world that any teenager would love to get into . \\nit\\'s almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance ( totally based on looks alone ) . \\nof course , there are those select few who may look slightly ugly , but compared to the average person , they are gorgeous . \\nimmediately , the film finds its tone and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time . \\nwe can turn off our brains , right ? \\nwrong . \\nwhile you may be expecting one thing to happen , it certainly doesn\\'t turn out that way . \\nthe film begins in a classroom , with nearly all the main characters present . \\nthere\\'s sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a counselor for the students . \\nhe\\'s heading the class discussion . \\nthere\\'s also kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , a snobby rich teen who has fallen in love with sam . \\nteaching the class , however , are two policemen : ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) , who want to talk about \\'sex . . . \\n ( cheers ) crimes ( boos ) \\' . \\n \" what is a sex crime ? \" \\nray asks . \\n \" not gettin\\' any ! \" \\none student responds . \\nthis pretty much sets the tone of the film we are about to watch . \\nhowever , upon hearing this , one student , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , stands up and leaves the room , commenting that they can both kiss part of her body . \\nand so , wild things sets into motion . \\nquickly , kelly begins hitting on sam , but sam doesn\\'t want anything to do with her advances . \\nkelly is stubborn and continues to pursue him . \\nshe even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep . \\nsurprisingly , that\\'s really all i can tell you about the plot . \\nany more would give away one of the many crucial plot twists . \\nand what\\'s more , these plot twists are actually unpredictable . \\ngoing along the way of scream , wild things maintains that film\\'s surprises , and then adds even more to them . \\nthere are more plot twists in this film than probably any i have ever seen . \\nand even though you think you may get tired of them , the surprises are so genuine that it\\'s rather pleasing . \\ngoing back over them in my mind , nearly all of them work , though some stretch the boundaries of belief . \\nthankfully , the convoluted plot doesn\\'t give us much time to think about each one , pouncing yet another twist on us before the shock of the previous one has worn off . \\nas for the critics who complain that the film is trashy--well , it is . \\nthis is pretty much just one trashy film . \\nhowever , it is the kind of trashy that isn\\'t hard to watch . \\nit\\'s good trash , in a sense . \\none , the screenplay knows that it\\'s not to be taken seriously , and it includes a lot of humor and satire into the story . \\nthis varies everywhere from kelly\\'s mother ( theresa russell ) , who is more of a caricature of rich people , all the way to an ambulance-chasing lawyer ( bill murray ) , who wears a neck-brace to cover an insurance scam he is running . \\nbill murray also provides the best character in the film , and most of the genuine laughs . \\nand two , the sex is more than gratuitous , although not unwelcomed . \\nwild things is supposed to have sex in it ( what film with that title wouldn\\'t ? ) , and this movie breaks the boundaries . \\ninstead of having heterosexual sex scenes , it also includes lesbian scenes between denise richards and neve campbell ( don\\'t worry . . . \\nit\\'s not as graphic as you might think ) . \\nthe heterosexual scenes are quite graphic , but the surprise shocker is kevin bacon\\'s full-frontal nude scene . \\nit\\'s very brief , so if you blink , you may miss ( ahem ) it . \\nand , for as long as i can remember , i don\\'t think i have seen an r-rated film show an erect one before ( it\\'s not completely , but judging from the audiences\\' reaction , it was more than they expected too ) . \\nalso , during one scene late in the film , there seemed to be a relationship brewing between bacon and dillon\\'s characters , but nothing came of it ( makes you wonder if the director had to cut it in order for the r rating , or if the actors refused to do it ) . \\nwhat first made me want to see wild things was its cast . \\nneve campbell , of course , has been one of my favorite actresses since the scream films were released . \\nhere , however , she turns every typical role she has done on its head and plays a gothic pothead . \\nthe closest role to this was her performance in the craft ( though even in that she was a nice girl ) . \\ncampbell is probably the best in the film and shows her wide range of talent . \\nyou can tell she will be around for a long time . \\ndenise richards will also be around for a long time , although she may be limited to the roles without much range . \\nhere , she gets to express more emotions than in her stiff ( yet effective ) performance in starship troopers . \\nhopefully one day she will land a very good role that can display her ability . \\nand then there is daphne rubin-vega , a newcomer to the movies . \\nshe gives a very good performance , although her character is mostly left to the background for the first hour and a half . \\ntowards the end she does get a bigger part . \\non the male side , matt dillon is probably the best , giving a subtle performance that surprises with every twist . \\nkevin bacon has a slightly wooden character , but he makes the most of it . \\nyou must have admiration , though , for what he did on screen . \\nand judging from many of the women\\'s reactions in the theater to that shot , they have grown a deeper appreciation for bacon ( yeah , right ) . \\nand then there is bill murray . \\nhis performance is the comic relief , and he nearly steals the film . \\nas a whole , the entire cast works wondrously together , and they seem at home , even when doing the menage a troi . \\ndirector john mcnaughton , who has previously done the critically acclaimed henry : portrait of a serial killer , has constructed a wonderfully twisty plot that works . \\nhis direction is smooth and stylish . \\nthe visuals are striking , filled with rich colors , and almost so realistic that we can actually breathe the humidity in the air . \\nhowever , he seems more at home when the actors aren\\'t talking . \\nhis fly-by shots of the swampy areas are brilliant , and his photography of denise richards\\' climbing out of the pool is a highlight . \\nthe cinematography is gorgeous in its details . its not often that you see a film like this , and we should watch it just to see how the camera can take pictures . \\nthen , there is the music . \\nthis was probably the most obvious thing to me , as it set the perfect mood for the film . \\nit\\'s hard to describe in words , so just see the film and listen to it . \\nit\\'s wonderfully composed and presented . \\nand be sure to stick around during the closing credits ! \\nmcnaughton has finally put the ending credits to good use ( while most comedies use it for outtakes ) . \\nhe has included some small scenes which help explain the preceding events . \\nsome may say that these are lame attempts to explain the convoluted plot , but it\\'s an entertaining way to finish the film . \\nplus , there are some shocking moments in these ending credits which just add to the fun . \\nwild things is appropriately rated r for strong sexuality , nudity , language and violence . \\nagain , the nudity is rather unnecessary , but let\\'s face it--people want to see it . \\nso why not give it to them ? \\nneve campbell , admirably , has a no-nudity clause in her contract , and the most you see of her is from behind as she takes her top off ( way to go , neve ! ) . \\nthe sex scenes are graphic , especially the first one we see , between the mother and one of her deck hands . \\none almost wonders how they got away with the r rating . \\nthe language is quite harsh too , ranging from sexual innuendo to your average , everyday profanity . \\nand i can\\'t stress it enough : don\\'t allow kids under 18 to see this film . \\nthe target age for the movie is the 18-24 range , and that\\'s who should see it . \\nit\\'s definitely not for those under 18 ! \\ndid i mention that this film is rated r ? however , for those that do get a chance to watch it , you will probably more likely be pleased , and may even take friends to see it the next time . \\n',\n",

       "  b'weir is well-respected in hollywood for turning scripts with difficult subject-matter into deceptively simple , powerful films , the mosquito coast ( utopia ) and fearless ( post-traumatic stress disorder ) among them . \\nin the truman show , weir essentially breathes life into the now-tired concept of media-manipulation by tackling the material from the inside-out . \\nit certainly helps that he has an underrated performer in top-form playing the title character , truman burbank . \\nby now you must be aware of the premise : unbeknownst to him , truman ( carrey ) is the star of his own tv series , a 24-7 peep-show in which he is surrounded by actors and placed in loosely scripted situations ; people around the world tune in for the voyeuristic thrill of his genuine reactions to fictitious stimulants . \\n`seahaven\\' , his hometown , and the show itself , are the brainchild of christof ( harris ) , who presides over his creation in the base of a fake moon , directing over 500 cameras and hundreds of actors and extras . \\nfor 30 years , truman suspects nothing-`we accept the reality we\\'re given , \\' poses christof-but a desire to break free of the sunny town and visit a long lost love in `fiji\\' ( mcelhone , who was actually an actress fired by christof for trying to break the confidentiality agreement ) overwhelms him . \\nthus , christof and his team suddenly find themselves working twice as hard to keep the veneer of seahaven intact , lest truman discover the world outside and put an end to the highly-rated program . \\nin a few broad strokes , weir creates a convincing second-reality , and he has the good sense not to bring christof into the picture until almost three-quarters through . \\nthis allows us to comprehend and accept truman\\'s world before we contextualize it . \\nfor all his madness , christof has shown the world a place without violence and hardship , and demonstrated that a human being can function well within it . \\ntruman is an inspiration to his audience because he grew up to be , well , so darn nice ; like a sibling ( or , perhaps more appropriately , a caged animal in an interactive zoo ) , they want to see him succeed . \\nthe surrealistic soap opera is completely plausible thanks to a tight screenplay and a sympathetic carrey-he really is an everyman here , abandoning his facial contortions in favour of a credible , wide-eyed bewilderment . \\ncinematically , the truman show is impeccable , stylishly photographed by peter biziou and littered with symbolic images . \\nas well , it employs wojciech kilar\\'s piece \" zycie za zycie\\' masterfully and beautifully . \\nif the film has any flaws , one may find them in laura linney\\'s characterization as meryl , truman\\'s \" wife \" ( i doubt that betty crocker impersonation would fool anyone ) , and in a subplot involving truman\\'s `father\\' , which feels curiously incomplete . \\nthere are a few stupendous sequences , and the film pulls off a wonderful trick : we become truman\\'s audience as much as the loyal viewers in the film . \\nthey wear buttons asking `how will it end ? \\' \\ni couldn\\'t wait to know myself , though i didn\\'t exactly want it to end , for this inspired movie is possibly the best-and most complex-summer picture in years . \\n',\n",
       "  b'seen august 8 , 1998 at 6 p . m . at rotterdam square cinemas ( rotterdam , ny ) , theater #6 , by myself for free using my sony/loews critic\\'s pass . \\n[theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture] \\nwar is a topic that can\\'t help but be glorified any way it is portrayed by the media . \\nmovies , documentaries , and even history books have a way of making the darker side of humanity exciting since the most general aspects are focused on , such as strategy , politics , and victory . \\nit\\'s easy to forget war , in its most basic form , is a battle of armies out to slaughter each other . \\nforgotten more easily is the fact that each soldier , no matter what his rank or importance , is a real flesh-and-blood person and not just a number . \\n \" saving private ryan \" is one of the few films that dares play up this aspect , especially in its unapologetic , realistic delivery . \\nit proves there\\'s a huge difference between battling and killing . \\nthe film opens with one of the most graphic , disturbing scenes in recent memory . \\nit\\'s world war ii , d-day to be exact , and the u . s . military is invading omaha beach where the nazis are more than ready for them . \\nspielberg uses many techniques to create for a total sense of reality . \\ninstead of positioned cameras , the footage here seems to have been shot by camera operators running alongside soldiers as if they were just as scared . \\nthere is no sense of stability , but of constant , anxious , and confusing motion , giving us the feeling of being in the middle of the battle , and just a vulnerable as the poor troops . \\n \" poor \" is a proper word to describe how pathetic and yet innocent the men fighting are . \\nthere is little to no dialogue throughout the loud battle and no prologue to define any characters . \\nwe don\\'t get the feeling these are handsome actors playing heroic roles , but that these are men about to kill and be killed for reasons beyond their understanding . \\nthe nazis are not portrayed as enemies to be hated , but as people that must be destroyed because they\\'re there . \\nin the movies , the good guys can run through a firestorm of bullets and bombs and not get a scratch , but in reality that wouldn\\'t happen . \\nthe men have nothing to shield or protect them besides some metal flanks and dead bodies . \\nthey are sitting ducks and we realize this through the perspective of the well-secured germans who can actually see who , what , and where they\\'re shooting , unlike the americans who must fire in a general direction to avoid getting their heads blown off . \\nperhaps the film is flawed by not providing any backstory on the war itself and who the men really are , but that seems to be part of the theme . \\nthe film seems to rely on the audience\\'s sense of patriotism , that the american military is \" right \" and good and that the nazis are \" inherently evil . \" \\nthe battle scene eventually focuses on a group of men who have miraculously survived and made their way close to the enemy stronghold ( a whole 50-foot progression ) , and begin to inflict some damage . \\ni have to admit that once the first glimpse of victory over the nazis sprang up , i couldn\\'t help but feel some sense of joy and relief . \\nto triumph against all odds is a cliche to be sure , but there\\'s nothing cliche about the graphic , detailed , atmosphere here because it really happened . \\none of the most surprising aspects of the film is how little story construction there is , and yet the events that take place make sense and are interesting . \\nthe plot is practically irrelevant since the film is more concerned with the reality of the war and the soldiers we meet . \\ntom hanks stars as captain miller , a relatively average man who happens to be the leader of a platoon . \\nhe\\'s never obsessive or any such generic , cartoonish characteristic that might dominate a character like this . \\nhe doesn\\'t want to be there any more than his men , but when he is given a mission he intends to carry it out . \\nthe mission the film is concerned with is , as the title states , saving private ryan . \\nthrough a series of command started by an ordinary clerical worker , it is brought to a general\\'s attention that three brothers from iowa have been killed in action and their mother will receive notices of each\\'s death simultaneously . \\nwhen they learn a fourth brother is stationed somewhere in europe , they make it a top priority to have him returned safely to his mother . \\nit\\'s easy to sympathize with this situation , after all , no one should have to lose all their children at once . \\nbut finding one man in this war is , as miller puts it , \" like trying to find a needle in a stack of needles . \" \\nthe saving of private ryan isn\\'t just a dramatic device , but a thematic one . \\nhis salvation represents the sense of innocence the country , the world even , was trying to convince itself it still had . \\nwhen miller\\'s company hears of the mission , they scoff at the idea assuming he is dead , but miller isn\\'t so quick to shrug it off . \\nhe knows the only thing that can really save soldiers from death is hope , and now he has the opportunity to make someone\\'s sense of hope a reality . \\nthe mission to find ryan gives miller\\'s group a destination , but not direction . \\nalong the way many things happen to them , both good and bad . \\na few battles are fought , not to be major accomplishments for the war , but because they encounter german soldiers and have no other choice . \\nthe act of killing itself becomes one of the film\\'s major philosophical metaphors . \\nthe soldiers don\\'t mind killing other soldiers in blind battle , but when they come across a lone survivor who begs them to let him go , they can barely stop themselves from killing him in cold blood as some kind of vengeance for their losses . \\nunfortunately , death is a fact of war , and most films try to avoid it when it comes to the main characters , but here spielberg doesn\\'t want us to think these men are invincible . \\nin fact , only a small amount of color and personality is sketched into each man , and the performances are good enough to make this method work . \\nalthough the characters are somewhat typical , the actors maintain control over the material at all time . \\nwhether they\\'re arguing with each other , telling stories of back home , or fighting the germans , they never go overboard and always seem believable . \\nsure , there\\'s a zinger here and there , but war doesn\\'t change the fact boys will be boys . \\nif and when one dies we too can feel the loss , even though we hardly knew them . \\nthe final act brings the story full circle with another tremendous , violent battle sequence . \\nprivate ryan has been found , but facing four to one odds , can the americans defeat the germans and keep ryan alive ? \\nthat\\'s not a premise for thrills , it\\'s symbolic of everything the film has worked for . \\nit would be wrong to say the film has either a happy or sad ending , it ends the way it must end . \\ni remember reading a \" calvin & hobbes \" comic strip where calvin asked his dad something like , \" dad , how do armies of men killing each other solve problems ? \" \\n \" saving private ryan \" is the adult version of that question . \\n',\n",
       "  b' \" tarzan and the lost city \" is one of the most anemic movies to come out in quite a while . \\nnot only it is poorly written , badly acted , and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas , it is thoroughly uninspired and insipid . \\nunfortunately , it\\'s not bad in the way great , colossal misfires like \" heaven\\'s gate \" ( 1980 ) or \" ishtar \" ( 1987 ) were bad . \\ninstead , it literally drips off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with , which begs the question of why it was made in the first place . \\nwith all the good scripts lying around hollywood un-produced , how does needless drek like this make its way to the big screen ? \\nof course , tarzan is one of the most filmed characters in all of motion picture history - he has appeared in over forty films , which have ranged from the very good ( 1984\\'s \" greystoke : the legend of tarzan , lord of the apes \" ) down to the really bad ( 1981\\'s \" tarzan , the ape man \" with bo derek ) . \\nmost of these films were just cheapie b-movies made in the thirties and forties , starring ex-olympic athletes and a lot of cutsie chimps . \\ntherefore , if another tarzan movie is to be made , one might assume that it would have something new to offer - a different angle , an original storyline , anything to set it apart from all the others . \\n \" greystoke \" added a never-before-seen level of realism to the pulpy tale , and even \" tarzan , the ape man \" at least had the mis-guided audacity to sexualize the story as a vehicle for bo derek\\'s bare breasts . \\n \" tarzan and the lost city , \" on the other hand , has absolutely nothing to offer but a bunch of recycled storylines and bad dialogue . \\nthe script , by bayard johnson and j . anderson black is about as formulaic and generic as they come . \\ncomic books have better plots than this . \\nthe movie is so bad , in fact , that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked in last summer\\'s comedy \" george of the jungle . \" \\ndidn\\'t the producers think to leave that back in the old weissmuller pictures where it belongs ? \\nthe story starts with the legend of tarzan already firmly established : a quick opening narration tells of tarzan ( casper van dien ) being found in the jungle after having been raised by apes , and his return to england where he assumes his greystoke heritage . \\nwhen the movie starts in 1913 , he is a civilized english gentleman ( without an english accent ) , and he is to marry jane ( jane march ) in less than a week . \\nhowever , when a wicked archeologist/grave-robber named nigel ravens ( steve waddington ) begins hunting for the fabled lost city of opar , one of africa\\'s last great secrets , the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to the jungle . \\nat first , jane refuses to go , pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding ; but after tarzan leaves she changes her mind and tracks him down , therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her and her ape-man . \\nonce the film gets going ( in its own sluggish way ) , it delves into a series of jungle adventures , as tarzan , jane , and the natives attempt the thwart ravens and his crew from discovering the city . \\nmost of the so-called adventures are cheesy , predictable , and unexciting , with no pace , tension , or action to speak of . \\nthere are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies , ranging from \" raiders of the lost ark \" ( 1981 ) to \" the goonies \" ( 1985 ) . \\nwhen the movie is running short on action , it includes a few greenpeace-friendly scenes of tarzan freeing caged animals , releasing a baby elephant from a trap , and throwing ivory tusks into the river . \\nthe movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality . \\nfor instance , when tarzan - who was raised in the jungle - is bit by a cobra , he doesn\\'t even attempt to suck the venom out like any semi-experienced weekend backpacker would do . \\ninstead , he ties a tourniquet around his arm and stumbles off into the jungle with no plan for survival . \\nof course , one can\\'t help but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is . \\nnot to ruin the ending or anything , but there is no lost city . \\nthere is , however , a lost pyramid , which i suppose is all the resource-strapped fx department could come up with ( the special effects are not worthy of a made-for-tv movie ) . \\nwhich also brings up the question of why the treasure hunters had to slog through numerous underground caverns to get to the lost pyramid , when it\\'s sitting right out in the middle of an open field ? \\nstrictly speaking , \" tarzan and the lost city \" isn\\'t even bad enough to have camp quality , although casper van dien\\'s laughably stiff performance comes real close . \\nthis movie proves what \" starship troopers \" only hinted at : he cannot act , but he sure looks well-groomed , even in the deepest heart of the african jungle . \\nvan dien is much too much of a pretty-boy to be an effective tarzan ; he\\'s a calvin klein model in a loin cloth . \\ni also wondered what the make-up department was thinking when it outfitted him with that awful circa-1983 steve perry haircut . \\nwaddington makes a decent villain , although he\\'s like a charmless version of belloq from \" raiders of the lost ark . \" as jane , the ex-model jane march has little to do but smile and look pretty next to tarzan . \\nshe does fire off a gun at the evil treasure hunters a time or two , but whenever a snake comes into the picture , she is reduced to a hysterical mess . \\nhowever , amidst all this complaining , i do have one piece of good news . \\n \" tarzan and the lost city \" is so lacking in ideas both new and old , that it is unable to fill even an hour and a half of celluloid . \\nso , we can say this much for it : at least it had the decency to be short . \\n',\n",

       "  b\"after a stylistic detour with mrs . \\nparker and the vicious circle ( which , despite its uncomfortable tone , was close to being a conventional movie ) , director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow , a romantic black comedy about love , betrayal , and self-absorption . \\nwhile these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture , rudolph's atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing , if not always pleasant , movie . \\nit is said that rudolph is a polarizing director ? meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it . \\nuntil mrs . \\nparker , i had not been overly impressed by his movies . \\ni found equinox , his last pre- mrs . \\nparker effort , to be irritating and frustrating . \\ni was somewhat surprised , therefore , to discover that i liked afterglow . \\nthere are several reasons for this , but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident , mannered aspects of his approach . \\nthe characters here are more like real people with genuine problems , the story is absorbing , and the acting is top-notch . \\nin short , rudolph has created a world that it's worth spending two hours in . \\nafterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples . \\njeffrey byron ( jonny lee miller ) is a cold , seemingly-heartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife , marianne ( lara flynn boyle ) . \\nfor her part , marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that she never attempts to interact with her husband on a human level . \\nall she's interested in is seducing him during those few days when she's ovulating . \\nafter he refuses to make love , she decides to find someone else to play the role of sperm donor . \\nthe other couple , lucky ( nick nolte ) and phyllis mann ( julie christie ) , are an older pair , but they're no more content than jeffrey and marianne . \\na mysterious fracture in their past relationship has driven them apart . \\nthey remain married as a matter of convenience , but , since phyllis won't allow lucky to touch her , they have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that no lasting bond is established as a result of these affairs . \\nthe landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable . \\nthe four characters begin interacting when marianne hires lucky as a handyman to fix up the inside of the apartment she shares with jeffrey . \\nthe two of them are immediately attracted to one another , and it doesn't take long before they're lounging together , naked , in her pool . \\nmeanwhile , jeffrey , who is captivated by older women , runs into phyllis in a hotel bar , is smitten , and invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat to the mountains . \\nthe romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love . \\nsex means something different to everyone ? to jeffrey , it's an unpleasant chore , a loss of control ; to marianne , it's a means to a maternal end ; to lucky , it's an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles ; and to phyllis , it's a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness . \\nultimately , none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves . \\nthe greatest strength of the film lies not in the script , but in the performances . \\njonny lee miller is perfect as the selfish , callous , suit-and-tie businessman . \\nthose who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity . \\nlara flynn boyle , who wasn't impressive in rudolph's equinox , is greatly improved , making marianne a jumble of sexiness and vulnerability . \\nnick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky , and he manages to deliver some of rudolph's most pregnant lines with practiced ease . \\nthe clear standout , however , is julie christie , who is nothing short of delicious as the world-weary phyllis . \\nher often wry , occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the film's humor , and there's hardly ever a moment when she doesn't steal the spotlight from her co-stars . \\ni don't know if afterglow is the film to convert rudolph- detractors , but it seems that this movie is a little more accessible than some of the director's earlier productions . \\nenough of his trademark style remains , however , to reassure his supporters . \\nafterglow is basically a four-pronged character study . \\nthe plot is not especially compelling , but the character interaction is , and that's the real reason to see this motion picture . \\nrudolph has painted an able picture of the non-romantic side of love -- the one that has more to do with tolerance and familiarity than with affection and attraction . \\n\",\n",
       "  b'ladies and gentlemen , 1997\\'s independence day is here ! \\nit\\'s title : starship troopers . \\nand surprisingly , it is more entertaining than id4 . \\ni realize that i gave last year\\'s sci-fi hit a 4 star rating , but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour . \\nafter subsequent viewings , i feel that independence day really wasn\\'t as great as it seemed--though i still give it a positive review . \\nstarship troopers , on the other hand , has a mocking sense of humor , knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem . \\nas a result , starship troopers is a more exciting , energetic , and lively science fiction film . \\nin fact , i probably could never get tired of watching this film . \\nstarship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars , another kick-ass space opera which reinvented the sci-fi drama altogether . \\nwhile starship troopers is no star wars , it comes quite close , and the easiest assessment would be to call this film : \" the \\'star wars\\' of the 90s . \" \\nam i being to generous to this film ? \\nperhaps , but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance , effectively , into the warring races . \\nin essence , this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction . \\nthe easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films , and i may have to . \\nstarship troopers is not quite an original film persay , but director paul verhoeven gives the film a \" kick-the-aliens\\'-asses \" style . \\nid4 had this same style , except it was forced , most likely the cause of will smith having a major role . \\nthis new \" star wars \" has a very simple , basic plot : mankind vs . an alien species . \\nthe alien species in question here is the bugs , a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid-type insects . \\nhowever , the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy . \\nsometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes , but during quiet moments , we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization . \\nmore than likely , these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends . \\nand they should be . \\ni doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thought-provoking film . \\nthis is an \" event \" film , but surprisingly above average . \\nit is extremely refreshing to watch a sci-fi war film , and actually root for the human side ( something independence day never achieved ) . \\nstarship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange \" join the army \" ads . \\nmixing a web-based interface , these summations of events are refreshingly original . \\nstating , \" would you like to know more ? \" , \\nthese short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor , and we know we should not take it seriously . \\nhowever , we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle , in a gory , yet funny , way . \\nafter witnessing the slaughter , the film jumps back one year , to setup what we just saw . \\nwe are introduced to johnny rico ( casper van dien ) and carmen ibanez ( denise richards ) . \\nrico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms . \\nhowever , carmen isn\\'t as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot . \\nhowever , another classmate , dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) , has her eye on rico . \\nunfortunately , rico isn\\'t interested in dizzy . \\nthis setup is rather cliched , as is the result of the setup , but it still is fun to watch . \\ncarmen signs up to become a starship trooper , and as a result , rico signs up . \\nand as a result , dizzy signs up . \\neveryone is assigned a certain position in the academy : carmen gets the pilot position she wanted , carl jenkins ( neil patrick harris ) , a psychic , gets a position in the training program , and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers : the mobile infantry . \\nthe main story follows rico through his trials and relationships . \\nin reality , i found myself watching a space version of \" melrose place , \" but with better special effects . \\nan hour into the film , the war begins . \\na sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film with . \\nthe first hour may have been a funny ( sometimes unintentionally ) setup , but we grew to care for the flat characters , because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters , their gorgeous looks won me over ( call me superficial , if you must ) . \\nfollowing the training sessions , which had many dramas in themselves ( too many to mention here ) , the troopers are sent to war . \\nthe bugs live on the planet klendathu , a planet which consists of dirt and rock , and pretty much nothing else . \\nmany dramas occur during the war , until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs\\' attacks . \\na sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense . \\nthe troopers are ordered to locate the \" brain \" and capture it . \\ni hopefully left the plot as vague as possible , because starship troopers is not about plot . \\nit\\'s about special effects and gory violence . \\ndirector verhoeven , most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct , returns to his sci-fi days , which gave us good films like total recall . \\nverhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa , but despite all the violence , the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood . \\nstarship troopers is extremely violent , with more gore than this year\\'s event horizon . \\nthe r rating is well deserved , and hopefully parents will not allow their 12 year old children to see it . \\nmy guess is that verhoeven\\'s target audience is the 18 to 25 male group . \\nthe film has a testosterone level off the charts , with chiseled men and beautiful women . \\ndespite these superficial elements , starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful . \\nwhile watching the film , we never second guess the character\\'s decisions because they seem perfectly clear . \\nthankfully , no hero is punching aliens in the face , which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with . \\nthe cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with , but they soon grow on you . \\ncasper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon . \\nto most guys , he will come across as artificial . \\nfortunately ,

. \\ndenise richards also does a good job , and her scenes are very well done . \\njake busey , gary busey\\'s son , gives a wonderfully funny performance , and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film . \\nneil patrick harris ( remember , he was doogie howser ) is a little wooden , and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast . \\nhowever , he does give a good performance . \\nmichael ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher with one arm . \\nhis performance rises above the rest . \\nperhaps it is because his character is the most developed , but i think it is just ironside\\'s presence on screen . \\nunfortunately , no particular cast member gives a star-making performance , which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars . \\ndirector verhoeven is the main star of the film . \\nhis direction is fast and unrelentless . \\nhe never slows down his pace , which makes for a wild ride . \\nwriter edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein . \\nthe writing is usually very funny , and sometimes very corny . \\nthe dialogue is smart but not too smart . \\nwe aren\\'t required to know everything , but some plot holes are left unanswered . \\nthankfully we are not intended to notice , and we really don\\'t ( except for one which lingered in my mind for quite a while ) . \\namazingly , with all the wars and romance going on , the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issues . \\nin fact , these governmental changes seem fairly plausible , and this adds another layer to the story . \\nthe moral debate of the characters is quite surprising to find in a film of this genre , but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage . \\ni haven\\'t laughed this loud , even in some comedies . \\noh , and the special effects are first rate . \\nstarship troopers is rated r for graphic sci-fi violence and gore , and for some language and nudity . \\nbelieve me when i say this : don\\'t take young kids to see this film . \\nit is extremely violent . \\nin fact , it is probably the most violent film out this year . \\nhowever , if you are old enough ( over 17 ) to see it , starship troopers is guaranteed to entertain . \\nit\\'s been a long time since i have cheered for the heros , while also cheering for the

       "  b'bill condon\\'s \" gods and monsters \" is a fascinating look into the last days in the life of gay director james whale ( ian mckellan ) , who made the horror classics \" frankenstein \" and \" bride of frankenstein . \" \\nsince i was unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film , there is no way to know how accurate the film is , but i suspect that much of it only came from whale\\'s inner fantasies and hallucinations . \\nwhale , who fought in wwi and then went on to become known for his work on horror pictures , decided fifteen years before his death at age 67 to quit filmmaking once a homosexual scandal broke out involving him . \\nas the film tells it , during the end of his life , whale , at his large home in l . a . , became infatuated with the tall , handsome , and much younger man , clayton boone ( brendan fraser ) , who was working as the gardener at his home . \\njames whale , we learn quickly was , what many people refer to him as in the film , \" a dirty old man . \" \\nin one of the opening scenes , a young film enthusiast visits whale\\'s home to interview him and whale agrees , on one condition : for every question he answers , the young man must take off an article of clothing . \\nbecause of this episode , we know exactly what it is whale wants when he asks clayton to pose for him for a painting , later making the excuse that his bright , white shirt is disracting only so he will take it off . \\nclayon agrees , and doesn\\'t really think much of this , much to the warnings of his friends , becoming more and more intrigued in the stories whale tells him about his past . \\ncertainly , the relationship between whale and boone is headed for a downfall , since whale starts to grow a deep love for this young man , even though boone is not gay , and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion to his life , as he begins to seldom suffer mild strokes and moments of true catharsis . \\n \" gods and monsters \" is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of a director who was forced to become somewhat of an outcast , due to his sexual preference , and never got the recognition he would have liked , since he longed to be referred to as a \" motion picture director , \" rather than a \" horror director . \" \\nand in one heartbreaking scene , he attends a party with boone being his guest , held by director george cuckor , and finds that many of the other attendees do not recognize him anymore . \\nit is evident that whale\\'s first love in his life was making movies , and when his career ultimately fell apart , so did his passion in life . \\nas played brilliantly by ian mckellen , james whale comes off as a sad , but dignified man , and a person who was not afraid to stand out from others , just as long as he knew he was being true to himself . \\nhe never hid the fact that he was gay , however , even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession , and it was this unblinking honesty that made him a great person . \\nthrough the complicated relationship that develops between whale and boone , boone , of course , only things of whale as a possible friend or someone he can talk to , while it means so much more to whale , who sees boone as sort of his salvation in life . \\nalthough boone is only in a dead-end job as a gardener of people\\'s homes , whale views him as the ideal man , not only one that is good-looking , even though it is this attraction that first begins his feelings , but one that will actually listen to him . \\nsince whale lives with only his loyal , but disapproving maid ( touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave ) , it is boone that whale can talk to in his ultimate reclusion from the world , and the only reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor . \\nalthough an extremely fine and mature picture , a few small elements hold the film back from ultimate greatness . \\nit is appreciated that the film does not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story developments , but it is a little thin , and the structuring of the \" on-again-off-again \" friendship at the film\\'s center is fairly predictable . \\nwe know early on where these two characters are headed , and we can guess that there will be a final confrontation between the two as the tension slowly builds . \\nin lesser hands , this set-up might have felt too calculated , but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment and writing that helps the film to be much more than this . \\nalso , a subplot is briefly brought up between clayton and a waitress working at a bar ( effectively played by lolita davidovich ) , but abruptly dropped and never brought up again . \\nif the film was not going to follow up on this side story , then it , perhaps , should have been taken out altogether . \\n \" gods and monsters \" is a heartfelt and intelligent motion picture , impressively directed by bill condon , who , i sense , relates to or fully understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between whale and boone . \\nthe film also plays as a tribute to a fine man who met an untimely end . \\nwalking away from \" gods and monsters , \" it was ian mckellen\\'s marvelous and astounding performance that left the most impression on me , and i doubt there could have been anyone who could have stepped into the role more fully and believably . \\nit is a sad testament when a person\\'s true talent and love is unfairly taken away from them , based on the scrutinization and judgement of their personal life , which , ironically enough , is no one else\\'s business in the first place . \\n',\n",

\\nwow ! \\nmike myers\\' third role is as fat bastard , a scottish henchman of dr . evil\\'s , who is sent to steal the mojo from austin powers\\' frozen body . \\naustin powers learns of dr . evil\\'s trip back into the 60s , and uses his own time machine to take him back to 1967 , to try to save his mojo before fat bastard gets a hold of it . \\nonce arriving in the year 1967 , austin travels to his \" pad \" , his smashing home/dance club , where he meets felicity shagwell , played by heather graham , a cia agent who is willing to help him in his journey to stop dr . evil . \\nas the film progresses , hilarious one liners are thrown at us , mainly by dr . evil , for example , \" don\\'t go there , girlfriend ! \" \\nto the president of the united states . \\nmany witty gags take place , note the entire tent scene , and just plain , funny scenes which are so stupid- they\\'re funny come a dozen per fifteen minutes . \\ntake for example , scott evil going on the jerry springer show complaining about how evil his father is . \\nthe way austin powers : tswsm uses its humor is clever , throwing a hilarious scene at you , followed by five minutes of one liners , followed by another outrageous scene , so you never stop laughing . \\nthere was honestly not one moment in austin powers : tswsm where i wasn\\'t laughing . \\nthe last film that i laughed so hard in , was well , austin powers ! \\nit is apparent that mike myers knew how funny this film was while writing it . \\nthe film even makes fun of itself in a line , something along the lines of , \" it\\'s funny how england and southern california look nothing alike . \" \\ntswsm was filmed in southern california , but was supposed to take place in england . \\ni can tell you one thing- he is having a lot of fun with this enormously popular character , which is all over television , newspapers , magazines , and the movie theaters . \\ni believe that dr . evil got more attention in the tswsm than austin powers did . \\ndr . evil provided more laughs , more memorable moments , and more interesting dialogue than austin did this time around , who seems to missing the funny touch that he had in the first film . \\ni felt that austin really did have his mojo taken away , but from screenplay writer mike myers , not fat bastard . \\nalso making a great addition to the series is mini me , who is played by verne troyer . \\neven though the midget actor is 30 years old , he is adorable by dr . evil\\'s side constantly . \\nthe first austin powers film had barely any sentimental quality , such as lack of character development , barely any detailed plot characteristics , and barely any good acting , but austin powers tswsm actually shows some quality behind the frequent humor . \\nmike myers , with his three roles , acts as eddie murphy did in the nutty professor , disguising himself completely in one of the roles . \\n ( fat bastard ) all three characters are different , and mike myers does do a good job handling each one of them . \\nheather graham made a great addition with her talent to tswsm , and does a much better job than elizabeth hurley did , who gave a very flat performance in the original , speaking her lines without any feeling or emotion . \\nspeaking of hurley , she can be seen in tswsm for a few brief moments . \\nhopefully , graham tags along for future austin powers adventures . \\nthe bottom line- a groovy sequel that mike myers put all of his mojo into writing . \\n',\n",

       "  b'contrary to the title , \" the boxer \" is not another rocky story only this time spliced with some cold hard politics . \\nit\\'s actually three movies in one : a political film , a boxing film , and a love story . \\nall of these work in their own respects and have some pretty decent balancing betwixt the three elements of the story , but somehow it seems kind of cliched and unoriginal . \\nwe\\'ve seen it all before , and we\\'re just not blown away with it like we should be . \\noh well . \\nit\\'s still an excellent irish story . \\n \" the boxer \" of the title is danny flynn ( jim sheridan staple daniel day-lewis ) , an ex-ira member who gets out of a belfast prison after 14 years , and finds out that his troubles are far from over . \\nfirst off , the ira is having a small civil war between its leader joe hamill ( brian cox ) , and one of its sub-leaders , harry ( gerard mcsorley ) , both having opposing views on getting many of their members out of jail . \\nwhile this is going on , danny and his old drunkard buddie , ike ( ken stott , who played the chief inspector in danny boyle\\'s \" shallow grave \" ) , re-open an old gym which allows the two opposing religios sects , protestant and catholics , to work together . \\ndanny not only begins teaching kids how to box , but has stayed in great shape whilst in prison , and is ready to start boxing real people again . \\nand danny runs into his ex-love , maggie ( \" breaking the waves \" \\'s emily watson ) , who hasn\\'t seen him since he went in . \\nthey don\\'t easily start up their romance again because she\\'s the wife of a prisoner whom she married during danny\\'s tenure in prison , and also has a son , liam ( ciaran fitzgerald ) , from him , whom liam is hoping will get out soon . \\nbut the two are slowly re-drawn to eachother again , and this begins to complicate things . \\nthe political story is nothing really special but works in itself . \\nwe\\'ve seen it many a time before , but it\\'s at least interesting , sometimes emotional , and even riveting at times . \\nthere\\'s a big riot towards the middle of the film which is frightening in its brutality and honesty . \\nthe boxing story is very minor to the story , but does represent people coming together to fight eachother fairly , and even with good sportsmanship . \\nthere are only a few boxing scenes , but they\\'re never like \" raging bull \" /let\\'s-strip-down-the-sport-to-its-bones brilliant . \\nthey\\'re more realistic , and instead of bone crunching , we hear the sound of the gloves hitting eachother , which is slightly unerving at times . \\nand i didn\\'t know daniel day-lewis was in such good shape . \\nbut the backbone of the story is the love one . \\nbecause these characters are given such horrible circumstances , and since the two leads have such great chemistry together , we really feel for their plight . \\nas the film goes on , and circumstances get worse and worse , the characters have to make real human decisions , and we can sympathize with them as humans not characters . \\nthis is how you write a love story - take note , hollywood . \\nthese elements are pretty much equally balanced , with each of the parts of the stories working hand-in-hand with eachother . \\ni loved how each of the different parts of the plot mattered , and sometimes spilled over into the next . \\nit made sure that we didn\\'t just care for one of them . \\ni\\'m not saying they\\'re all equally great , because the love story really carries the film , but at least they all work out respectively . \\nthe acting is amazing , with day-lewis and watson giving excellent performances and showing great chemistry . \\ni\\'m not sure if they\\'re oscar-nominee bound , but they\\'re very good . \\nin the supporting roles , billy cox is greatly sympathetic as the ira leader losing control of his daughter and his workers . \\nbut the film is stolen acting wise by ken stott as ike , who is just a great scene stealer . \\nthe direction and co-writing by jim sheridan ( with the other co-writing credit going to terry george ) is excellent , rounding out the characters well , but not pacing everything greatly . \\ni noticed that the first half was very leisurely ( yet fascinating ) , but the second half whirls by at a quick pace , and ends much too quickly . \\nmore time could have been spent thinking up the ending , since it does seem quite sloppy . \\nthough \" the boxer \" is a good film , it never achieves the greatness that it should . \\nsure , it\\'s a masterpiece compared to most of the hollywood drivel we usually get , but on it\\'s own , it just could have been better . \\nbut it still works out , gives us a great love story combined with a political and boxing drama , and features great acting . \\neven if it could have been better , this\\'ll do . \\n',\n",

       "  b'way of the gun is brimming with surprises , some good , most bad . \\none of the good ones is ryan phillippe\\'s surprisingly halfway decent performance . \\nafter the actor gained much attention by posing and preening through teen swill like i know what you did last summer , he hinted at a bit growth in last year\\'s cruel intentions with his amusingly contemptuous john malkovich meets james spader performance , though his acting in that film faltered around the third act mark , precisely when the screenplay made his character grow a heart ( presumably to appeal to his training bra wearing fans ) and start bellyaching about how he\\'d fallen for his \" target \" . \\nit was a dramatic shift that neither phillippe nor the film\\'s director could negotiate . \\nbut he seems to be trying and that shouldn\\'t be overlooked ( or probably over praised ) seeing as how , at this point , he really isn\\'t required to do much but look pretty . \\nhere , phillippe has procured a five day growth of beard , his hair askew and his affect altered to sound something like james cagney in all his \" look here , see \" glory . \\nit\\'s tough to believe a pretty boy like phillippe as a hard ass , but his performance actually helps with the illusion . \\nunlike ben affleck\\'s puppy dog approach in reindeer games , phillippe is believable and not too bad at that . \\nas for the plot , well , that\\'s one of the bad surprises ; phillippe and the great benicio del torro play two moronic ( and not even remotely likeable ) criminals ( introduced to us in the parking lot of a rave where they stupidly pick a fight with about twenty people ) who hatch a scheme to kidnap a surrogate mother ( juliette lewis ) after overhearing that she\\'s carrying the baby of painter ( scott wilson ) , a very well connected wealthy man . \\nthe kidnapping devolves into a laborious shoot out where much damage is done and many are killed . \\nbut the anti-heroes escape with the woman while an aging hit man ( james caan ) and two scheming bodyguards ( taye diggs and nicky katt ) remain in pursuit . \\ndirected by christopher mcquarrie , the screenwriter who won an oscar for his work on usual suspects , an overrated piece of crime noir in many circles ( this one included ) , way of the gun is a hodgepodge of crime thriller motifs that just oozes eye rolling familiarity . \\nunlike phillipe , mcquarrie doesn\\'t seem to be growing at all ; he fills his flick with a sprawling labyrinth of plot all snatched from movies i know i\\'ve seen before and worse , it feels like it . \\nthe film lacks even a fresh approach ( like what soderbergh did out of sight or the limey ) to its clich ? s , all of which are spewed before us in a picture that tries so desperately to be hip and gritty without bothering to notice how common it is . \\nit features characters living by a code they seemed to have picked up in sam peckinpah 101 rather than any thing resembling life . \\neven attempts at emotional weight feel strained like in preposterous scene where enemies james caan and benicio del torro stop in their tracks to have a cup of coffee and pontificate on life , philosophy , etc . i didn\\'t like the bit much when it first appeared in heat , here , it\\'s even more self consciously \" dramatic \" . \\nusual suspects , which also featured a bunch of low lives that seemed to live by a code they learned from the movies , worked to some degree because of that astonishing twist ending . \\nnowadays an astonishing twist per ending is de rigeur , never mind if it deems all that transpired before it completely inconsequential . \\nthus , nearly every character in way comes with at least one dirty little secret ( most amateurishly projected before they appear ) and it too has an ironic little twist at the end ( nothing earth shattering , like in the usual suspects ) but i admit , i didn\\'t see it coming , and i smiled . \\nhowever most of the movie feels exactly like the interrogation scenes between palminteri and spacey in usual suspects : a lot of faux huffing and puffing with no rhythm or reason . \\nor substance . \\nit\\'s just as overplotted as suspects , and often dull as any overplotted movie without interesting characters , a distinctive style , or a good script would be . \\neven the good stuff , most of which involves james caan ( doing a fine job ) , feels odd and out of place in a movie that thinks lines like \" karma is only justice with out the satisfaction \" are clever . \\nat one point caan laments \" need is the ultimate monkey \" a line so inexplicable he might as well have said \" love is like hippo ass \" . \\ni\\'ve seen porno with better dialogue . \\nand some with better plot lines too . \\nbut rarely has porn offered up such a talented cast ( i mean , can you even compare james caan to ron jeremy ) . \\ncaan slips into this role with seeming ease , he could do this kind of soft-spoken tough guy in a coma , but he manages to give his character depth and weariness . \\nbenicio del torro is always welcome , though here he plays it fairly straight ( rather than another oddball character creation like the ones the actor gave us in usual suspects and excess baggage ) , adopting a brad pitt-esque quizzical pout to go along with his heavy swaggering . \\nspeaking of pitt , his ex , juliette lewis , is a weak link , either shouting her lines with ear shattering shrillness , or waddling about like a silly goose . \\nnicky katt was brilliant in a brief role in the limey , here his role is just as brief only he seems wasted ; he\\'s only kept around for his cold presence . \\ntaye diggs has a similar function , cool as ever , but never a character , though the guy has one helluva death scene . \\nfor the most part way is incessantly talky with no reason to give a hippo\\'s ass about any thing that transpires since its characters are never more than simplistic pawns . \\nit\\'s vaguely tarantino-ish , but in a bad truth and consequences nm way , with phillippe , in one scene , leaping into a stupid rant about \" faggots \" migrating to los angeles . \\nyou know the routine . \\nthe final shoot out is pure bargain basement john woo ( who himself seems to be doing bargain basement john woo ) with interchangeable bad guys lining up to be shot at . \\nbut those gun shots sure crack like thunder . \\njust the other day i was watching an old dirty harry movie on cable and was stunned to hear the weak elephant grunt-like sound that emanated from harry\\'s fetishized smith and wesson . \\noh how far we\\'ve come . \\n',\n",

       "  b'jacques tati\\'s 1953 classic \" les vacances de m . hulot \" ( also known as \" mr . hulot\\'s vacation , \" in english ) ought to be the textbook on how to do non ? dialogue comedy in film . \\nthe characters hardly ever speak to each other directly , and the film operates on the paper ? thin premise that monsieur hulot , played by tati himself , is awkward and clumsy and generally manages to annoy the other guests at the beach resort hotel where he is taking a week\\'s vacation . \\nyet the film had me beside myself laughing more consistently than any in recent memory . \\npart of the reason the film works so well is the clever setup for the various gags . \\nslapstick has often been regarded as an unsophisticated and even crude form of comedy , but i think part of the reason for this is that it often seems forced : you can only see movie characters start running after something and then crash face-first into a pole so many times before you start to wonder what all these poles are doing there in the first place or why these people don\\'t watch where they\\'re going . \\nin \" les vacances de m . hulot , \" the gags build upon each other and often start out relatively low-key . \\nin one sequence , for example , hulot is painting the side of his small row boat on the beach when , while his back is turned , the paint can gets caught up in the oncoming waves , washes away , then comes back up on the other side of the boat . \\nwhile crossing over to get the can , hulot steps in the boat and unknowingly cracks it . \\nwhen he actually takes the boat out into the water , it breaks in half , but the two halves flip up against each other , trapping him inside as the bystanders mistake it for a shark fin and panic on the beach ensues . \\ntati doesn\\'t waste a single opportunity for humor ; scenes that might have yielded one joke in most comedies are good for at least four or five in this film . \\nit has been said that comedy relies on frustrating the audience\\'s expectations , and \" les vacances de m . hulot \" succeeds brilliantly in that area as well . \\ntati accomplishes this largely through a sort of deadpan understatement . \\nwhen hulot goes into a separate room during dinner and starts playing a record at defeaningly loud volume , no fights or shouting matches ensue ; instead , the waiter calmly walks in and shuts off the power in the room , disconnecting the record player and leaving a puzzled hulot sitting in the dark . \\ntati also uses running gags to this effect , allowing them to keep running far longer than most comedy directors would ; more often than not , we can see them coming and think , \" oh , he\\'s not going to do that again , \" but , lo and behold , he does . \\nfor example , there is a recurring joke in which hulot\\'s noisy , sputtering car engine wakes everyone in the middle of the night as an exterior shot reveals the hotel\\'s lights coming on one by one . \\nthen this image turns up again in the finale , which i will not give away other than to say that involves a lot more noise in the middle of the night than a car engine could ever produce . \\nthe ending is one of two elements that really make this a four-star film as opposed to merely an above-average , clever comedy . \\nas much as i was laughing during this film , i was thinking to myself occasionally that tati had to top himself at the end to really make this work as a complete viewing experience ; suffice it to say that he did . \\nthe other important aspect is that the film never seems disdainful of its characters . \\nit easily could have turned the tables on hulot and had the other guests exact some kind of revenge on him ; alternatively , it could have portrayed the others as humorless curmudgeons . \\ninstead , tati seems to regard his characters with cheerful amusement more than anything else and invites the audience to like them , however strange or irritating they might seem . \\n \" les vacances de m . hulot \" is not subtitled , but the dialogue is sparse and for the most part not terribly essential to the flow of events . \\nanyone with a taste for this kind of absurd humor ought to make this film their next rental from the video store . \\nnote : \" les vacances de m . hulot \" was not rated by the mpaa . \\nit would at most receive a pg rating . \\n',\n",
       "  b'set in the late 80\\'s at the height of yuppie excess and based on the book by bret easton ellis ( who explored the same themes in another book which was also made into a movie , less than zero ) , american psycho puts a new spin on the yuppie \" genre \" that ellis helped to create . \\nchristian bale is perfectly cast as patrick bateman , a high powered yuppie who hides a terrible secret from his fianc ? e and his colleagues . \\nit seems that bateman is a serial killer and , unfortunately for his contemporaries , his tenuous grasp on reality is starting to slip . \\nas he tries to balance his meticulous daily routines with slaughtering co-workers and prostitutes and hiding their bodies , his mental fabric slowly begins to unravel . \\ni was first introduced to the novel when i was still in high school . \\ni read an associated press article in our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis was having getting his novel published due to the controversial violence in it . \\nas usual when anything is controversial i try to seek it out , but i soon forgot about the novel and didn\\'t end up thinking about it again until i stumbled across it a couple of years later at a bookstore . \\ni picked it up and read it , but was ultimately disappointed because it left more questions than answers . \\nthe movie has a similar effect , but at least it\\'s less cryptic than ellis\\' novel . \\nfor once , a film has actually turned out to be better than the novel it was based on . \\nboth the book and the film open with bateman describing his fastidious morning preparations ( down to exactly what facial scrubs and exfoliating creams he uses ) but the novel seems to concentrate more on these excesses throughout . \\nthe movie continues to touch upon these things but makes more of a point to immerse us in bateman\\'s impending madness than to detail things as painstakingly as the novel does . \\nas a result , the film is immensely more entertaining . \\nlions gate seems to be the studio champion of controversial films ( having picked up kevin smith\\'s catholic-rattling dogma ) and here with american psycho there is no difference . \\nscreenwriters mary harron and guinevere turner had the unenviable task of trying to take a novel about yuppies filled with graphic violence and sex and make a marketable film out of it . \\nsome cuts had to be made to the finished film to keep from getting an nc-17 , mainly involving a sex scene comprising bateman and two women , and initial reports said the film was unwatchable . \\nthankfully , it is watchable and harron and turner have made one of the most scathingly satirical films this side of south park : bigger , longer & uncut . \\nside note #1 : co-writer guinevere turner also makes an appearance in the film as an ill-fated acquaintance of bateman\\'s who , after bateman suggests that she start making out with a female prostitute , proclaims that she\\'s not a lesbian nor has any interest in it . \\nthe ironic humor of the scene stems from the fact that turner ( the writer/director of the film go fish and who also assisted kevin smith with parts of his script for chasing amy ) is a lesbian . \\nit\\'s a subtle in-joke and it\\'s one i found to be pretty humorous . \\ndespite having a rather high profile supporting cast of young up-and-comers ( including reese witherspoon ) , most of the roles are a waste and are the equivalent of extended billed cameos . \\nthe real draw here is christian bale and his over-the-top performance as patrick bateman . \\nwhenever i read a novel i always try to imagine what it would be like as a movie and who would be perfect to cast as the characters . \\ni always had a hard time trying to decide who i would cast as bateman , but i never thought bale would deliver a performance as perfect as his ends up being . \\nto say bale runs away with the character is a vast understatement and he proves that he\\'s as adept at chewing scenery as al pacino or rod steiger . \\none sequence in particular , involving bateman describing his love for huey lewis and the news\\' song \" hip to be square \" right before burying an axe in a co-worker\\'s head , features one of the most eccentric and kinetic performances i have ever seen on film . \\nside note #2 : despite the fact that huey lewis\\' \" hip to be square \" and a pair of phil collins songs appear in the film , don\\'t expect to see them on the soundtrack release . \\nhuey lewis expressly requested that his song , featured in a rather large set piece in the film ( much akin to the use of \" stuck in the middle with you \" in reservoir dogs ) , not be included on any soundtrack release . \\ni\\'m assuming that collins requested the same . \\non a similar note , whitney houston\\'s cover of \" the greatest love of all \" is also involved in a scene comparable to the other two and it is very obvious that it isn\\'t the houston version at all but merely an instrumental version culled from an unknown source . \\napparently , houston wasn\\'t as open about the use of her song as the others were . \\na bigger controversy than the violence and sex has been brewing since the film\\'s release : that of whether or not patrick has actually committed the crimes we have viewed during the course of the film . \\ndon\\'t look to the book for any answers because it will only serve to confuse you more . \\nseveral web sites have been dedicated to the subject but i\\'m still undecided . \\nthere is evidence both for and against but the most scathing evidence against comes from a scene near the end of the film where bateman goes on a killing spree taking out cops , old ladies , and cleaning staff with equal gusto . \\nthe scene seemed very dream-like and as absurd as the action films it suddenly seems to be parodying ( as an example , bateman blows up a police car very cinematically after firing several shots from a handgun in the general direction of the car ) . \\ni kept waiting for bateman to wake up and for the film to continue on from there , but bateman never does wake up and the whole sequence , though comic , throws the film off-balance ( which i suppose was the intention ) . \\nother than the few flaws i have mentioned , american psycho is an incredibly entertaining film ( although you may not leave the movie fully understanding whether or not what has just transpired actually occurred in bateman\\'s reality ) . \\ni think this movie is destined for greatness as a cult film and deserves the spot it will take as such . \\nit may not change anyone\\'s life , but it will certainly have an effect . \\ni know i will certainly hear \" hip to be square \" in a different context the next time i hear it . \\n[r]

he also penned the wonderful sleeper , mystic pizza . \\nthe film , like the play , is set in atlanta , georgia , and it revolves around two people in their twilight years : a cranky , 70-something jewish widow who feels guilty about her wealth and a 60-something black man who becomes her chauffeur . \\nthe movie relies on character , rather than plot , to propel the action . \\nin fact , the movie has no discernible plot in the traditional sense ; it doesn\\'t present a linear story in which all the scenes flow together . \\nrather , driving miss daisy is made up of the routine activities of everyday life : shopping , listening to the radio , visiting the cemetery , eating fried chicken , and so on . \\nthe film also incorporates into the story line actual events in atlanta\\'s history , including the 1958 bombing of the temple ( the city\\'s oldest jewish congregation ) and a 1965 ceremony honoring the reverend dr . martin luther king , jr . \\nthe story begins in 1948 with daisy ( tandy ) crashing and wrecking her packard as she pulls out of her driveway . \\nthe insurance company cancels her insurance , and her son , boolie , decides to hire her a chauffeur . \\nfreeman , reprising his role from the play , plays the chauffeur , hoke . \\nthe film chronicles the warm friendship that slowly but surely blossoms between the chauffeur and his reluctant passenger . \\ndriving miss daisy is a movie about human nature , aging , prejudice , and a great many other things , but more than anything it\\'s about a relationship : one that spans 25 years , 4 cars , the advent of civil rights , and one gravely important 33 cent can of salmon . \\ndaisy is strong-willed and set in her ways , and , from the outset , she is utterly opposed to the idea of having a chauffeur . \\ninitially , she treats hoke with contempt , refusing to let him drive her anywhere . \\nonce she does get in the car , daisy is the ultimate back-seat driver . \\nto make matters worse , she is extremely self-conscious about what others might think if they were to see her being escorted around town by a hired hand . \\neventually , however , daisy is worn down by hoke\\'s good-natured charm and infectious cheer ; she softens and opens up to him . \\ntandy plays the part of daisy exceedingly well , but unfortunately this feisty , cantankerous character is just a smidgen too commonplace . \\nwe\\'ve seen this woman countless times before in other incarnations , from on golden pond to cocoon . \\nnevertheless , tandy manages to put enough of a personal stamp on the familiar character to make it her own . \\nfreeman , as hoke , on the other hand , gives the more distinctive of the two performances . \\nthere is something profoundly moving about the way hoke maintains his pride and dignity in a society which forbids him from using public rest rooms because of his skin color . \\nhoke is uneducated and illiterate , but freeman always suggests that there is something more to this man , an inner strength beneath the simpleton exterior . \\nboth freeman and tandy seem to be in their element , in full command of their natural charisma . \\nthey flirt with the camera and dominate scenes without overtly calling attention to themselves . \\nthey bring a light touch to their humorous banter and to the movie\\'s gentle humor . \\nat the same time , tandy and freeman provide more than a few moments of truly poignant drama . \\nin his first dramatic role , dan aykroyd is surprisingly chubby and unexpectedly effective as boolie , tandy\\'s loving and patient son . \\ndrama seems to agree with aykroyd ; taking a break from comedy seems like a good move for the actor , especially when you consider the wretched comedies he has made recently ( ghostbusters ii , the great outdoors , my stepmother is an alien ) . \\nthe only other significant characters in the film are daisy\\'s housekeeper , idella , marvelously played by esther rolle ( \" good times \" ) , and boolie\\'s pretentious wife , played by patti lupone . \\nunder the direction of bruce beresford ( crimes of the heart , tender mercies ) , driving miss daisy seems a bit stagey now and again . \\nbut fortunately , beresford never forgets he\\'s shooting a movie , and accordingly , he offers plenty of striking cinematic touches , such as gorgeous shots of flowers , trees , and tomatoes . \\nin adapting driving miss daisy from the stage to the screen , the filmmakers have achieved a delicate subtlety . \\nuhry understands that what his characters do not say can be just as important as what they do say . \\nberesford wisely exercises restraint in the film\\'s dramatic moments . \\nthe movie tugs at your heart , but it never goes for the jugular . \\nthe only sap in driving miss daisy is in the trees . \\n',\n",

       "  b'when i saw the trailer for this film , i laughed harder than i had in quite some time . \\nwhile i was therefore pretty well psyched to see it , i was ever mindful that a trailer can make even the most mediocre film look good . \\ni\\'m happy to say that there\\'s something about mary is not one of those trailer let-downs . \\nin fact , watching this film was quite a fine way to spend two hours . \\nthe film opens up in flashback to 1985 , at a high school in cumberland , rhode island . \\nted stroehmann ( ben stiller ) is a social reject who can\\'t seem to get a date to the upcoming prom , until he comes to the defense of the mentally retarded warren ( w . \\nearl brown ) , who\\'s being harassed by one of the school jocks . \\nit seems warren\\'s sister is the campus queen , mary jensen ( cameron diaz ) , who is impressed with ted\\'s willingness to stand up for her defenseless brother , despite a very real chance of getting beaten up . \\nmary takes an immediate liking to ted and asks him to the prom . \\nted was just flattered that she even knew his name . \\nunfortunately , prom night is ruined when ted has an accident with his zipper ( at which every man in the theater will wince ) , and is sent to the hospital . \\nfast forward to the present , where ted has cleaned himself up , now writes for a magazine , but has weekly therapy sessions in order to deal with his obsession of the past 13 years : mary , whom he hasn\\'t seen since that fateful day . \\nwith the help of his friend dom ( chris elliott ) , ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy ( matt dillon ) to track down his only love . \\nhowever , when pat finds mary , he falls for her too , and soon the both of them are competing for her affections . \\nthere\\'s something about mary is directed by bobby and peter farrelly , who brought us dumb and dumber and kingpin . \\nnot exactly intelligent comedies , they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends or co-workers to think you had such a great time watching them . \\nwith their current film , the farrelly brothers have come up with something you\\'ll not only enjoy , but also won\\'t mind talking about the next day at the water cooler . \\nthe film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic styles , from the subtle to the ridiculous , and while a few of the gags might be offensive to some ( seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers\\' last two films ) they almost all work . \\ni have not seen many movies in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on . \\none minute you\\'ll be laughing at something ted says , and the next you\\'ll be howling at the sight of a dog dragging him across the floor of mary\\'s apartment . \\none of the great things this film has going for it is ben stiller . \\nhe is perfectly cast in the role of ted , because he\\'s a guy who just looks awkward in almost every situation . \\nted\\'s a nice fellow and tries to do his best , but for some reason or another things just don\\'t always work out . \\nit\\'s comical , but also has that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him to come out on top . \\nactually , i\\'ve liked stiller since he did a short which aired on saturday night live back in the mid-eighties . \\nthe film was like a theatrical trailer for a spoof on the tom cruise/paul newman film the color of money , entitled the hustler of money . \\nin it , stiller played wince ( not vince ) who is taken under the wing of an older man ( played by john mahoney ) to become a big-time bowling hustler . \\nit was parody at its finest , more of which showed up in the short-lived \" the ben stiller show \" on the fox network in late \\'92/early \\'93 . \\nlike \" the critic \" ( which aired on abc , then fox ) , i still mourn that show\\'s cancellation . \\ncameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film , although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she dates , and some of the qualities she looks for make mary look paper-thin at times . \\nhowever , diaz pulls the role off with such panache and charm , that you can still see why she\\'s got guys just falling over each other to be with her . \\nheck , i even found her laugh to be cute , even though i thought it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week . \\nmy girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesn\\'t change , and you know , it\\'s really true . \\nhe and ralph macchio must hang out or something . \\nmaybe they live in dick clark\\'s pool house . \\nanyway , here\\'s another good piece of casting , as dillon slips beautifully into the role of the guy who tries to worm his way into mary\\'s heart . \\nthe supporting performances are also good . \\nchris elliott has a bigger part than in the abyss ( yes , check it out next time ) , and less annoying than in cabin boy . \\nlin shae , who plays mary\\'s neighbor magda ( and also appeared as the landlady in kingpin ) , provides some good laughs , especially in scenes with her benji-like dog , which acts as the focal point for a few of the funniest moments of the film . \\nlee evans , as mary\\'s friend tucker , displays a flexibility in acting and accents which surprises and contributes to an interesting plot twist . \\nthe farrelly brothers and scriptwriters ed decter and john j . strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there aren\\'t any noticeable times where the film drags . \\nthe only problem i saw was their use of a couple of musicians who provide segues between several key scenes . \\nthey appear out of nowhere and actually sing plot-relevant information right toward the camera . \\nit\\'s a device which was amusing for about three seconds when they opened the film . \\nafter that it got a little annoying , and it\\'s unfortunate that those spots interrupt what would otherwise be a smooth flow . \\nfortunately , filled with sight gags , humorous lines , and solid comedic acting , there\\'s something about mary will still have you laughing after you leave the theater . \\n',\n",

       "  b\"depending on your degree of cinematic acumen , last man standing is either a ) a prohibition-era remake of akira kurosawa's 1961 classic yojimbo ; b ) a prohibition-era remake of sergio leone's 1964 classic a fistful of dollars ; c ) a prohibition-era action drama with a completely original story-line . \\nnew line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category ( c ) than in the other two combined , much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons . \\nthe fact is that there is yet another way of looking at last man standing , which is as the first film version of the story which nods to the _real_ source material , the dashiell hammett novel _red harvest_ . \\nit also shows that kurosawa and leone knew better what to do with that material than hammett himself . \\nthis time around , the man with no name is played by bruce willis , a fellow with a shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the texas border town of jericho one day on his way to mexico . \\nby all appearances , jericho is well on its way to becoming a ghost town , with the few remaining inhabitants generally belonging to one of two bootlegging operations fighting for control of liquor coming over the border . \\none is headed by an irishman named doyle ( david patrick kelly ) ; the other is run by chicago-connected italian mobster strozzi ( ned eisenberg ) . \\ncalling himself john smith , the man decides that there is money to be made from the conflict , and hires himself out as an enforcer to doyle's side . \\nbut smith's allegiance is as uncertain as his name , and he begins to play the two sides against each other while trying to stay one step ahead of both of them . \\nviewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story will find virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting standpoint , and that alone should make last man standing somewhat more respectable than other recent hollywood remakes-cum-bastardizations . \\nthere is the happily ineffectual lawman ( bruce dern ) , the unhappily detained object of one of the bosses' affections ( karina lombard ) , the barkeep who becomes our anti-hero's only friend ( william sanderson ) , suspicious lieutenants ( christopher walken and michael imperioli ) to question the bosses' trust in smith , a brutal beating , and a big fire . \\ndirector walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids , including a pair of guns for willis which have the ability to propel an assailant backward with sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity , but at least he doesn't try to turn the story into a slasher film or a buddy picture . \\nwhat he _does_ do is nearly as big a mistake , and that is to provide a running voice-over narration by willis which rings of the standard hard-boiled style of pulp detective fiction . \\nyes , that narration is full of cliches , but those are are not particularly troubling . \\nthe problem is that both yojimbo and a fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters . \\nthey were a mystery , to the other characters in the film and to the audience , their motives never entirely clear even after they have acted , and that quality contributed to their almost mythical status . \\nwith john smith's voice chattering on in the background and allowing us into his every thought , he becomes more mundane , just another tough guy trying to stay alive . \\nit feels like a hammett novel , all right , and hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice , but it simply doesn't work . \\nthe narration allows the man with no name to take us into his confidence , and the man with no name takes _no one_ into his confidence . \\neven if you walk into last man standing as a blank slate , i can't imagine it being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction . \\nwillis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith , but there is still a level on which he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than everyone else rather than smarter than everyone else . \\nchristopher walken plays doyle's brutal henchman as a slight variation on his gallery of soft-spoken psychos , and there isn't another single character whom makes even the slightest impression . \\nwith no compelling antagonist for smith , there is no build-up towards the expected showdown , and when it does come , that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about . \\ncinematographer lloyd ahern ( who also did the only noteworthy work on hill's 1995 flop wild bill ) creates some nifty sunburned vistas , but his work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and the next bit of counter-productive narration . \\nsometimes when someone sees a lackluster remake of a revered original , they'll wonder what all the talk was about . \\nin the case of last man standing , it is those who know the originals who will wonder what all that talking was about . \\n\",\n",
       "  b'with the exception of their surrealistic satire barton fink , the films of joel and ethan coen fit into two broad categories : quirky and sometimes darkly humorous takes on the \" film noir \" genre in which crime schemes go wrong and spin increasingly out of control ( fargo , miller\\'s crossing , blood simple ) , and off-the-wall comedies centered around an eccentric , scatter-brained lead character ( raising arizona , the hudsucker proxy ) . \\ntheir latest offering , the big lebowski , falls within the latter category , though there are elements of the crime-gone-wrong theme and even a touch of satire to be found in this film . \\nthe main difference , however , is that while the protagonists of raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations and ideals but didn\\'t quite have the brains to get it all together , the main character of the big lebowski seems like a fairly intelligent guy who\\'s wise to the world , but he doesn\\'t really want to do much of anything besides go bowling , smoke pot , and generally relax . \\nthat main character is jeffrey \" the dude \" lebowski ( jeff bridges ) , introduced by the film\\'s rambling narrator ( sam elliott ) as \" quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county . \" \\nthe dude is unemployed , needless to say , and spends most of his time at the bowling alley with his two best friends , walter ( john goodman ) , a borderline-psychotic who\\'s in the habit of pulling a gun when he thinks somebody\\'s cheating in a bowling match ( \" has the whole world gone crazy ? ! \" he shouts at a suspected cheater ) , and donny ( steve buscemi ) , who\\'s always a few steps behind the conversation and is constantly berated by walter for it ( \" donny , you have no frame of reference here ! \" ) . \\nthese three seem to more or less live for bowling tournaments , and as the film begins they are anticipating an important match with rival bowler jesus quintana ( john turturro ) , who , when we first meet him , is doing a dance in the bowling lane to accompany a spanish version of \" hotel california \" and , if it\\'s possible , seems to be even more of a head case than walter . \\nif that doesn\\'t give you a good idea of this film\\'s absurdist tone , then perhaps this will : the entire scenario which drives the story is set in motion by two thugs mistakenly urinating on the dude\\'s rug . \\nthey\\'ve mistaken him for a millionaire of the same name who is also known as the \" big \" lebowski ( david huddleston ) and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny ( tara reid ) owes money to porn producer jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ) . \\nthe dude goes to the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug ; he doesn\\'t have any luck , but when bunny is apparently kidnapped , the elder lebowski asks him to deliver the $1 million ransom . \\nunfortunately , walter gets involved and fouls up the drop-off , and before they can try again to get the money to the supposed kidnappers , the dude\\'s car gets stolen , along with the briefcase containing the money . \\nsoon , the dude is being harassed not only by the big lebowski himself but also by treehorn and by a group of german \" nihilists \" who demand the ransom money even though they may not have been involved in the kidnapping in the first place ; the dude and walter suspect that bunny may well have kidnapped herself in order to extort money from her husband to repay her debts to treehorn . \\nmeanwhile , the big lebowski\\'s daughter maude ( julianne moore ) , a feminist avant-garde artist who likes to make grand entrances swinging through the air naked , wants to recover the money for her family . \\nthe plot , however , is really just a vehicle for all these bizarre characters to run wild and wreak their own unique forms of havoc . \\nthe previews for the big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revival\\'s \" run through the jungle , \" and it fits : the coens see los angeles as a veritable jungle of oddballs and nutcases , with the sometimes bewildered dude left to run through it and try to avoid any more trouble ( usually unsuccessfully ) . \\nthe film doesn\\'t feature quite as many one-liners and sight gags as the coens\\' other comedies ( though there are a few hilarious moments of visual humor , particularly in the dude\\'s dream sequences and acid flashbacks ) , but it more than makes up for it with the sheer fun of watching these strange characters interact . \\nthe film sometimes seems a little disjointed as a result - you get the feeling that the coens have not only set their characters loose in this \" jungle \" but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle of their own twisted imaginations - but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough to overcome the shaky plotting and what turns out to be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution . \\nthere\\'s also a noticeable ( but not too heavy-handed ) thread of social commentary in the big lebowski , which , incidentally , takes place just as the gulf war is about to begin ; at the beginning , we see george bush on television making his \" this aggression will not stand \" speech . \\nthe coens take aim at just about every elite l . a . subculture in the book : the egotistical wealthy businessman ( \" the bums will always lose !

       "  b'brian depalma needs a hit * really * badly . \\nsince scoring big with the untouchables in 1987 , depalma has seen casualties of war , raising cain and particularly the disastrous bonfire of the vanities go down in flames . \\nconsequently , it would be easy enough to consider carlito\\'s way a shrewd commercial choice for depalma , reteaming with al pacino ( scarface ) and returning to the gangland ground which has yielded his two greatest box office successes . \\nit doesn\\'t hurt any that he has latched on to a solid story and brought out dynamite performances from pacino and sean penn . \\ncarlito\\'s way , while hampered by depalma\\'s characteristic excesses and stylistic cannibalism , is a truly tense and engrossing drama . \\ncarlito brigante ( pacino ) is a life-long criminal who finds himself unexpectedly given a second chance . \\nin 1975 , carlito is released from prison after serving only five years of a thirty year sentence when his conviction is overturned on a technicality . \\nhe declares himself reformed , tired of life on the streets and determined to fulfill his simple dream of buying into a rental car business in the bahamas . \\namong those who find this conversion hard to believe are david kleinfeld ( penn ) , carlito\\'s crooked attorney and childhood friend , and bodyguard pachanga ( luis guzman ) . \\ncarlito rediscovers old flame gail ( penelope ann miller ) , and seems ready to retire in peace . \\nold ways die hard , though , and old associates pull carlito step by step back into a life he can\\'t seem to shake . \\ncarlito\\'s way will probably make the strongest impression with the two outstanding set pieces which bracket the film . \\nin the first , carlito accompanies his young cousin on a drug buy which will have anyone with a pulse on the edge of their seat ; the film closes with an equally thrilling chase through the new york subway and grand central station . \\nboth highlight depalma\\'s gift for choreographed mayhem , and these are not the only occasions when the stage blood flows freely . \\nyet for all the viscera , i found the character study even more compelling . \\ncarlito brigante has a lot of michael corleone in him , an aging gangster trying unsuccessfully to go legit . \\nbut where the culmination of the godfather saga played like opera , there\\'s more of an immediacy to carlito\\'s way , an ever-present sense of doom launched by the title sequence which sets the flashback story in motion . \\nyou sense that there\\'s no way , after so many years , that carlito can stay out of trouble . \\nindeed , he observes that his attempt at the straight life is more a function of time than a change of heart : \" you don\\'t get reformed ; you just run out of wind . \" \\npacino captures carlito\\'s dilemma with surprising subtlety and the cautious observation borne of years of experience watching every corner for an enemy . \\nsean penn is even better , turning in his best performance to date as kleinfeld . \\na jew in the world of puerto rican and italian wiseguys , kleinfeld is an outsider with a huge chip on his shoulder . \\nhe could have been simply pathetic , a heavy drinker and cocaine addict playing tough with guys way out of his league , but penn invests kleinfeld with tremendous nervous energy and an overwhelming survival instinct . \\nhe shows a man moving steadily towards the brink , making the moment he goes over quite jolting . \\nas compelling as the narrative is , viewers may experience a profound sense of deja vu . \\ndepalma continues to steal shamelessly from other directors , this time adding scorsese to his repertoire with a point of view tracking shot and a copacabana scene with more than passing resemblances to goodfellas . \\nhe even recycles some of his own previous plagiarisms , like a 360 degree swing around a kiss ( vertigo via body double ) and the climactic shootout which will strike many as far too reminiscent of the train station sequence from the untouchables . \\nfrom a story standpoint , there\\'s an obligatory love story with a cliche\\'d long-suffering girlfriend character . \\npenelope ann miller is a good but limited actor who doesn\\'t do anything new with the role , and eventually she becomes just a distraction , never integrated fully enough into the story . \\nstill , it\\'s easier to be forgiving of superficial flaws when the backbone is so solid . \\nthe two principle characters held an iron grip on my attention , one all the cinematic thievery in the world couldn\\'t break . \\ncarlito\\'s way plays like a tragic novel : deliberate , confident and powerful . \\nthose willing to grant depalma his tendencies towards the extreme should find themselves well- rewarded . \\n',\n",
       "  b'if there\\'s one thing in common about all of hollywood\\'s major studios , it\\'s that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more . \\nalthough twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures ( fox searchlight and fine line respectively ) , it\\'s obvious there\\'s no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater . \\nso when a movie like gary ross\\' pleasantville comes along , wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production , it\\'s a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes . \\nalthough the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted , pleasantville should not be mistaken for a no-thought movie . \\nquite the opposite is true , in fact , as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen . \\nthe story , both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation , captures the essence of statement-making in the cinema . \\nnot in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution , and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross\\' work , it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough . \\nkudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture . \\nit stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who , through quite a bit of luck , find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named \" pleasantville . \" \\nmaguire , as the reserved bud parker , is perfect for the pseudo-world ; but the rebellious mary sue ( witherspoon ) is not at all made for the father-knows-best times . \\nit\\'s not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end , and begins to teach the townspeople - in a quite unlikely way - what life is * really * like . \\nsoon hues of color creep into the black and white world , and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism , others fear the strangeness . \\nat one end is a soda shop owner-turned-painter named mr . johnson ( jeff daniels ) and at the other end is a close-minded mayor ( j . t . \\nwalsh ) and his chamber of commerce ; but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town . \\nfine performances are turned in all around . \\nmaguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads , but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j . t . \\nwalsh ( in his latest and final posthumous performance ) . \\ndaniels brings an atmosphere of awe , inspiration , and hope to his character , whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness - almost to the point where you can sense gene hackman\\'s envy . \\nfor daniels , it\\'s his most commendable performance of the last three years - or more - and for walsh , it\\'s a complementary exclamation point on a fine career . \\nalso of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen , and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish . \\nthere\\'s not much to dislike about pleasantville , and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who don\\'t . \\n',\n",
       "  b\"in 1970s , many european intellectuals , especially those on the left political hemisphere , became obsessed with the rise of fascism . \\nwhich wasn't so hard to expect , because the social turmoil of 1960s and economic decline of 1970s seemed to be the breeding ground for many dangerous ideologies . \\nin such times , when political involvement could be associated with noble passion , many filmmakers tried to warn the present generations of dangers that lurk ahead by giving the look of pre-war europe and circumstances that led to phenomena like fascist italy and nazi germany . \\nof course , there were authors who jumped on the bandwagon for other , less noble reasons . \\nfor them , moral depravity of fascism could be explained to the audience by explicitly showing sexual depravity of those era . \\nwhich , naturally , made some of those films very popular among teen audience . \\none of such filmmakers was italian director tinto brass , who later made career shooting expensive , stylish soft porn . \\nsalon kitty , his 1976 film , is very losely based on the novel by peter nordern , book that deals with bizarre yet true story that took place in the first years of ww2 . \\nin 1939 , walter schellenberg , one of the heads of nazi intelligence service has set up the elite , exclusive brothel in berlin with clientele comprised of top nazi officials and foreign diplomats . \\nnone of the customers knew that the girls were all nazi agents , and that all the rooms happened to be bugged . \\nthe most bizarre thing is the fact that not even kitty , nominal madame of the brothel , didn't know the real purpose of that enterprise . \\nscreenplay by tinto brass , of course , simplifies the story and changes few names . \\nschellenberg is now wallenberg ( helmut berger ) , ambitious nazi official who wants to use the brothel in order to blackmail his way to the top . \\nkitty kellerman ( ingrid thulin ) , apart from being madam , has a second job as a cabaret singer . \\ncaught in the net of depravity is sweet , innocent girl margerithe ( theresa ann savoy ) thrown into brothel . \\nthere she falls in love with customer hans reiter ( bekim fehmiu ) , disenchanted pilot of luftwaffe . \\nwhen margerithe discovers that her lover had been executed for defeatist speeches he made in the brothel , she finds out that the place is bugged . \\nshe informs the madam of the real situation , and both women decide to confront wallenberg . \\nthose who tend to bash benigni for exploiting holocaust as the topic of comedy would probably go bananas watching this film , that uses the darkest pages of european history for cheap sexploitation . \\nbut , although salon kitty doesn't happen to be anything more than rather more stylish and expensive soft porn ( although not very successful ; some of supposedly erotic scenes are quite unappealing ) , it does try to have more multidimensional characters and even something resembling dramatic conflict - this time between power-hungry and scruples wallenberg and hedonistic womanhood symbolised by kitty . \\nunfortunately , brass seems to overuse other cinematical references , probably thinking that he could repeat the successful interaction of berger and thulin in luchino visconti's the damned , but the most noticeable and irritating is ingrid thulin's unsuccessful attempt to imitate lisa minelli's musical numbers from cabaret . \\nall in all , salon kitty is failure , although with some very interesting moments . \\n\",\n",
       "  b'vampire lore and legend has always been a popular fantasy element , substantiated by not only the sheer number of movies about the subject , but also the proliferation of cults and sects of adherents . \\nand , unlike any of the more outlandish myths , the vampire holds some real-world probability ( one study claims 1 , 000 bloodsuckers exist worldwide , and places 50 in los angeles ) . \\nbut lest the nasties be mistaken for simple comic book bad guys , john carpenter would like to remind us that they are - and always have been - a truly frightening element of the thriller genre . \\nand remind us he does in his latest film , vampires . \\nthere was some question , as halloween weekend approached , of how well vampires would do in comparison to new line cinema\\'s immensely successful blade , released in august . \\nthe two films take noticeably different stands on the vampire issue , and don\\'t even agree on some basic points of the slaying method . \\n ( for instance , blade\\'s main weapons are silver and garlic , whereas main character jack crow\\'s technique is a wooden stake to the heart . ) \\nblade also gives more of a face to the vampire civilization , while carpenter would like us to remain in the dark about how the pasties operate . \\nboth have their advantages , and here , carpenter\\'s style lends itself to a darker breed of suspense rather than the action movie that blade director stephen norrington delievered . \\nwhen it\\'s all said and done , though , the vampires still kill and die with a bloody flourish ; the level for gore is indeed set to maximum . \\nthis time , our hero is vatican-sponsored slayer jack crow ( james woods ) . \\nhe\\'s a cynical , battle-worn veteran , and the best of his bunch . \\nhe and his team are responsible for cleaning out the american southwest , and after exterminating a nest one night , they run up against a super-vampire ( termed a \" master \" ) named valek ( thomas ian griffith ) . \\nvalek kills all of jack\\'s team except for his partner , tony montoya ( daniel baldwin ) , and as the two regroup , they learn that valek is the original vampire - now over six hundred years old . \\napparently , valek and his minions have been sweeping the southwest for decades in search of a cross that will enable them to walk in the daytime . \\nso with the aid of a priest named adam ( tim guinee ) and a bitten hooker ( sheryl lee ) as bait , they track valek down for the final confrontation . \\nthe script for vampires , written by don jakoby and based on the john steakley novel , is perhaps the wittiest piece of screenplay to see production all year . \\ncrow , in particular , is a fun source of one-liners , and woods does every one of them with perfect stoicism . \\nbaldwin , lee , and guinee are all fine supports , adding to the character pool , but the other true highlight of the movie is thomas ian griffith\\'s bad guy . \\ngriffith\\'s intense expression is perfect for the role , and the only downside is that he\\'s got to talk sometime . \\nluckily , he\\'s got few lines , and manages to pull off a rather thrilling performance . \\nall said , fans will surely be impressed by this picture , and those who found apt pupil a bit limp will be excited by this one . \\ncertainly a worthwhile visit to the theaters . \\n',\n",
       "  b\"well , what are you going to expect ? \\nit's a movie about a big snake that eats people . \\nthat's what i should have been thinking when i viewed this film , because maybe then i would have enjoyed myself more . \\ninstead , i ended up wishing a giant snake would come along and eat me , too . \\nanaconda is about a documentary film crew sailing down a south american river . \\nled by anthropologists dr . steven cale ( eric stolz ) and terri flores ( jennifer lopez ) , the crew is attempting to locate a lost tribe of natives . \\nalong the way , they find poacher paul sarone ( jon voight ) , and become unwillingly embroiled in his quest to capture the elusive anaconda . \\nto simply say that this is the world's largest snake wouldn't be doing it justice , since the anaconda in this movie is at least two feet wide . \\nif this isn't a good reason to avoid picking up hitchhikers , i don't know what is . \\nat the beginning of anaconda , we find that flores and cale have had some kind of relationship in the past , but that seems to be more or less over now . \\ni expected that fact to play a key part somewhere down the line , but it ended up being a set-up for nothing . \\ncale chokes on a deadly wasp ( don't ask me how that happens - i don't know ) and is put out of action , relegated to being the person whom the rest of the film crew must get back to civilization for medical help . \\nthis minimally helps to add a sense of urgency for the plot , since this goal now comes in direct conflict with sarone's plan to capture the snake . \\nhowever , this is negated by the fact that cale seems to get better by himself about halfway through the film , and in any event still results in zero payoff from the relationship angle . \\nmost bad characters are either annoying or stupid . \\nin this movie , they're both . \\nsince this description applies to all the characters except sarone , it's hard to find someone to root for . \\nyou're supposed to back the good guys , but you really end up cheering for sarone because he's smarter than everyone else . \\nor maybe he's just not as dumb as everyone else . \\nat times , i almost found myself rooting for the snake . \\nthere are no standout performances here . \\neveryone seems to be reciting lines written for stock characters . \\neven voight appears to be doing his best impression of christopher walken for some reason . \\nno matter , as in most monster movies , the snake is supposed to be the real star anyway . \\nin most of the scenes , the snake is computer generated , and the effects crew did a decent job of making it look real . \\nhowever , the realism is thrown off by some pretty unrealistic occurrences . \\nsometimes , for example , the snake just moves too fast . \\nit catches a guy jumping off of a waterfall , for crying out loud . \\nthen there's another scene where the snake eats one of the characters , and we see the snake's skin drawn so tightly over its prey that we can see the victim's pained expression from within the snake's belly . \\nabsolutely ridiculous . \\na testimony to the film's bad direction is the inclusion of a scene early on the in the film , where we get to see just how dangerous the mighty anaconda is . \\nin a scene totally unrelated to anything else , we are witness to the big snake winning a showdown with a panther . \\nthe anaconda wraps itself around the powerful feline as if it were a stuffed animal and squeezes it so hard , one of the panther's eyeballs pops out . \\neeeewwwww . \\nabove and beyond the sick factor , however , this scene surprised me because it actually showed the face of the snake before a quarter of the movie had even passed . \\nin films like these , a sense of mystery surrounding the monster must be maintained . \\nif the characters are reacting to something they fear more than see , we as an audience must experience that feeling along with them . \\nto show us the monster early on is to let us in on something the characters don't know about , and therefore allow us to get used to the danger before the pivotal moment when man and beast have their climactic showdown . \\nin a case like that , the showdown just ends up being a letdown . \\nwhen i saw the snake for the first time , i decided to give the film the benefit of the doubt and assume that the snake i saw wasn't the real danger . \\nthis one was just a decoy , and there was actually a bigger snake waiting to make its appearance just when everyone thought they were safe . \\nno such luck . \\nokay , maybe anaconda is actually a decoy , and there's really a better movie waiting to make its debut . \\n\",\n",

       "  b\"when the film features richard lynch in the role of chief villain , you know that you can expect nothing more than a b grade action movie . \\nhowever , since this film also featured michael madsen , more than capable character actor , this time in the role of protagonist , the author of this review decided to give the film some benefit of the doubt . \\nhowever , the very first scenes show clear b grade action credentials - madsen plays richard montana , tough policeman who raids a drug warehouse and make life miserable for local crime lord mario gio ( played by lynch ) . \\nhowever , the raid was only partially successful , and montana is getting the rap . \\nso , he begins his own private war against gio , trying to penetrate his organisation pretending to be corrupt . \\nin the process , he meets gio's mistress gina zamora ( played by rosie vela ) and starts relationship with her too . \\nalthough it doesn't stink like many of the similar films can , inside edge is mostly forgettable b grade action routine . \\nnobody in this film actually puts much effort , including madsen or lynch , and this is especially case with uninspired screenwriter william tannen or director warren clarke . \\nthe only not so forgettable element in this film is presence of former supermodel rosie vela , who , apart from showing her more than impressive looks , shows some of the singing talent too . \\nhowever , this isn't reason enough for viewers to spend hour and half watching a film that they would , in most likelihood , forget the next day . \\n\",\n",

) . \\nthe use of the punk hardcore soundtrack in pam\\'s crazed scenes comes rather too close to making emotional disturbance seem glamourous and sexy an image which only detracts from the rest of the film . \\nindeed , as in mcnaughton\\'s seminal film henry : portrait of a serial killer , it is the avoidance of glamour or sensationalism , the denial of some of the standard thrills of the outlaw film genre , that gives this determinedly unflashy , moving film its great strengths . \\nmcnaughton has filmed this story with a quiet , coolly \\'realistic\\' method that works far better than any nbk theatrics at unsettling the viewer . \\nthe suburbs , with their miles of white-fenced houses and identikit malls , take on a sense of claustrophobic blankness . \\nin its very different way , this makes for as haunting a backdrop as the wide open spaces in terence malick\\'s badlands . \\nwhile pam shares the yearnings of malick\\'s heroes to escape from ordinary life , chris takes up crime precisely so that they can lead a \\'normal life\\' - their little house on the suburbs is financed by his violent robberies . \\nbut these are dreams defined by , constrained by , and even doomed by , the limitations of the \\'normal\\' , conventional world . \\npam\\'s final scene takes place at the edge of the suburbs , where wild bushes grow -- symbolically the frontier , the outer limits of her society , but also quite literally the end of the road , where there is nowhere left to go but to the final tragic denouement . \\nthe flying inkpot\\'s rating system : * wait for the video . \\n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \\n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \\n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \\n * * * * * perfection . \\nsee it twice . \\n',\n",

       "  b'in brief : best bleak comedy film since heathers . \\nfull of wonderful swipes at the fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so much of modern american pop culture . \\ngo see it ! \\nso , i prepared for this film by watching a moving interview on \" hard copy \" with pam smart , the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted of engineering the death of her husband back in the 1980\\'s . \\n \" hard copy \" \\'s diane diamond asked smart what she thought about nicole kidman\\'s fictionalized portrayal of her in the new film to die for . \\nsmart replied that she thought kidman\\'s character came off as a dumb , vicious tramp and she thought that the publicity the new movie generates might just hurt her chances in her latest court appeal . \\n ( smart was convicted and given a life sentence for her part in the murder of her husband . ) \\nsmart\\'s got a point . \\nit wouldn\\'t be the first time that the public took the better scripted and well-acted movie version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller and far less artistic real life version . \\nhowever , given a choice between the mass media \\'happening\\' of the real event and the fictionalized movie , i would definitely opt for the later . \\nreal murderers rarely have dialogue as witty as what buck henry has written for this movie and smart , while pretty and alluring , is no match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman . \\nto die for begins in a town called little hope , new hampshire , the archetypal dry and intellectually barren american suburb . \\nthe story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone and how she tackles the obstacles between her and her life long ambition of being \\'on tv . \\' \\nof course , one of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull and unambitious husband larry , played by matt dillon . \\nbut , with a little imagination , some charm and raw sex appeal and a rather novel approach to junior achievement , our heroine manages to overcome the nay-sayers in her life , at least temporarily . \\nkidman triumphs in the trashy role of suzanne . \\ni have never really been all that fond of this actress but she shows a wonderful flair for comedy in this picture . \\nher portrayal of the incredibly shallow and dumb femme fatale resonates . \\nkidman knows a star-making role when she sees it and she plays the conscience-deprived suzanne as the ultimate career driven , post-feminist uber-temptress from hell . \\nshe is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue , which kidman delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way . \\nat one point suzanne is expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husband and sister-in-law . \\n \" you know , \" she knowingly exclaims , \" gorbachev would still be the leader of russia or whatever , if he had just had that ugly purplish thing removed from his head . \" \\nher husband beams at suzanne\\'s profound knowledge of world politics and then proudly proclaims that this qualifies her to be the next barbara walters . \\nthis is very close to pop culture bashing heaven , folks . \\nthe other standout performance in the film is delivered by joaquin phoenix . \\nhe plays jimmy , a burned out teenager who becomes addicted to suzanne\\'s sexual favors . \\nkidman\\'s character , vapid though she is , is a sort of suave beacon of success to jimmy and his lost friends russell and lydia , winningly portrayed by casey affleck and alison folland . \\nphoenix looks like the very embodiment of gen-x slackerhood ( as envisioned by tabloid tv , of course ) . \\nhis jimmy has the dead eyes and demeanor of a kid who knows that he ain\\'t going anywhere , ever . \\nphoenix reacts to the sexy suzanne with a sort of obsessed amazement and he makes us believe that a loser character like jimmy really would be willing to kill for someone like suzanne , someone who actually noticed him . \\ngus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , my own private idaho ) direction is first-rate . \\nhe keeps the pacing in this not-quite-thriller snapping along . \\nvan sant rightly keeps the focus of this movie on the amoral suzanne and doesn\\'t stop to proselytize the audience about the rightness or wrongness of her actions . \\nvan sant trusts his material and trusts his audience to \\'get it\\' without stopping to explain what is funny about this all-american story . \\nthe screenplay , by buck henry , is absolutely great and includes some of the best bleakly comic lines i\\'ve heard since heathers . \\nhenry\\'s story is a blast against the shallowness of the american media and the mindlessness of fame , yet the screenplay delivers this sharp message by focusing on just a few characters . \\nhenry ably manages to avoid diluting his story by aiming at too many targets and the result is a crisp and funny mini-classic . \\ndanny elfman did the original music for this movie and he delivers another eccentric , loopy score that strongly echoes his themes for edward scissorhands . \\neither film score would make wonderful background music for halloween trick-or-treat parties . \\nall-in-all , a wonderful production

       "  b'fritz lang\\'s first american film since leaving nazi germany , is an eye-opener about a lynch mob in a small town . \\njoe wilson ( spencer tracy ) is a regular joe , a hard-working stiff , a decent guy , who is living with his two brothers , tom ( walcott ) and charlie ( albertson ) , in chicago . \\nhe is engaged to katherine grant ( sylvia sidney ) , but can\\'t save up enough money to marry her . \\nshe takes the train west for a better paying job as a teacher . \\nbefore she departs , she gives him the wedding ring her father gave to her mother , sews up his ripped trench coat , corrects him when he mistakingly says the wrong word for memento , and kisses him goodbye . \\na year goes by and joe buys a car and tells katherine that he will meet her to get married in capitol city , that he has quit his job and hopes to open a gas station . \\ndriving through the rural backroads and camping out at night while going to met her , he arrives at a near-by town called strand . \\nbut the deputy sheriff \" buggs \" meyers ( walter brennan ) comes upon him waving a shotgun and arrests him . \\nhe accuses him of the kidnapping of a little girl . \\nthe sheriff ( ellis ) finds salted peanuts on him just like the kidnapper had in his pocket , he also has a five dollar bill on him that matches one of the numbers of the ransom money , and he fits the general description of the suspect . \\nlocked in jail , he waits for the district attorney to look at his claim of innocence . \\nin the local bar , the town citizens go into a rage when learning that an arrest has been made in the kidnapping . \\nfueled by angry talk about getting back at the kidnapper and of having the deputy inadvertently telling them of the ransom money found on the suspect , a mob storms the jail , burns it down and dynamites it when they can\\'t get through to the prisoner\\'s jail cell . \\nthe sheriff called the governor for the national guard , but one of his political advisers countermanded that request , saying it wouldn\\'t look right for the governor in an election year to call out troops for those he wants to vote for him . \\nsomehow joe escapes , but his dog rainbow dies . \\nkatherine hears what has happened on the radio and rushes to the neighboring town of strand only to see him engulfed by flames in his cell , and becomes convinced that he died . \\nthe next day the newspapers announce that the guilty kidnapper confesses . \\njoe makes his way back to chicago and tells his brothers , who are startled to see him alive , that he wants revenge . \\nhe thereby supplies his brothers with the names of the 22 leaders in the lynch mob . \\nan ambitious district attorney ( walter abel ) prosecutes the 22 for murder . \\nkatherine , not knowing he\\'s alive , remains in a state of shock , but is asked to be a witness that she saw joe burning to death . \\nthe defense claims that it can\\'t be a charge of murder without a corpse . \\nthe trial proves to be interesting , as the citizens in this close-knit , respectable community , lie under oath , providing alibis for each other to prove they couldn\\'t have been at the jail . \\nthe sheriff also lies , saying he can\\'t identify anyone in the mob . \\nbut proof comes by way of a newsreel cameraman who caught the whole incident on film . \\nas for proof of the corpse , an anonymous letter is addressed to the judge enclosed with the wedding ring katherine gave joe . \\nin the note , memento is misspelled , which makes katherine realize that joe is alive . \\nwhen the sentence is announced , 20 of the accused are found guilty of murder , but joe marches into the courtroom and gives a pious speech about what happened . \\nkatherine forgives him , and this very strong film ends on a weaker note than i think it should have . \\nbut don\\'t blame lang for all the changes in the film , of trying to take the town off the hook by introducing this wild revenge motive . \\nmgm couldn\\'t bear to have it made the way lang wanted it , that is , by having tracy die in the lynching . \\ninstead they wanted to stop short of condemning so many small american towns where lynchings actually do occur , and they thereby meddled throughout the entire script . \\nto lang\\'s credit , even if this film failed to be a masterpiece because of the interference , it still did not let the good citizens off the moral hook . \\nhis portrayal of the attempted lynching was powerfully done and was not compromised . \\nyou couldn\\'t help get the feeling that the citizens didn\\'t care that much that they almost lynched an innocent man , but cared more about protecting the reputation of their town and would do anything to keep their 22 vigilantes from going to jail , even perjuring themselves . \\ntheir reaction to seeing joe alive was satisfying only in that it meant they weren\\'t going to be convicted . \\nlang by no means implies that the town has learned its lesson from this incident . \\nhe does imply that a dark side to joe wilson has been exposed , and the innocent , jovial good-guy , seen in the beginning of the film , has been largely altered forever by this traumatic experience . \\n',\n",

       "  b' \" sometimes the \\'green mile\\' seems sooooo long . \" \\nindeed . \\nand any filmmaker with a three hour movie who ends it with that gem of dialogue should expect to see it quoted in a review . \\non a more positive note , let me add that sometimes the green mile is almost good enough to make us forget its length . \\nthe mile in question ( green due to its faded lime-colored linoleum ) leads from the prison cell to \" old sparky , \" the electric chair where executions were carried out at louisiana\\'s cold mountain penitentiary in 1935 . \\npaul edgecomb ( tom hanks , you\\'ve got mail ) is the head guard of e-block , otherwise known as death row . \\nkeeping his prisoners calm as they await the carrying out of their sentence is his primary responsibility . \\nit is a responsibility which he capably delegates to the other guards on his watch by insisting they \" talk to \" the convicts instead of yelling at them . \\nthis practice leads to an unusual camaraderie between the guards and the men behind their bars . \\ninto his charge comes one john coffey ( michael clarke duncan , armageddon ) , a seven foot tall gentle giant who has been convicted of the rape and murder of two young girls . \\nimmediately , paul senses something different about this prisoner . \\nperhaps its the way he asked for a night light because he is frightened of the dark . \\nor perhaps it is the mystical healing powers he demonstrates as he \" takes back \" paul\\'s bladder infection thereby restoring him to health . \\nbased on steven king\\'s 1996 serialized novel , the green mile does offer other characters who have stories to be told : eduard delacroix ( michael jeter , patch adams ) , is a frail cajun convict who befriends and trains a mouse to do circus tricks ; percy wetmore ( doug hutchison , a time to kill ) , is a young and sadistic guard sitting on a transfer to a more lucrative position because he has yet to see a prisoner \" fry \" up close ; and hal moores ( james cromwell , babe : pig in the city ) is the compassionate warden for whom , despite all the executions he\\'s witnessed , death never loomed as large as when his own wife was diagnosed with a tumor . \\nwhile it is mr . hanks \" everyman \" performance at the center of the film which gives it the anchor to hold our interest for 180 minutes , it is the performances of his supporting cast that are most worth noting . \\nall involved do credible work in their respective roles , most especially mr . duncan , who turns in an impressive , fully realized characterization . \\nif only the story were more credible . \\nwriter/director frank darabont ( the shawshank redemption ) has crafted a flawed fantasy/allegory of sorts ; one which is more spiritualistic than spiritual , relying on a preternatural mysticism rather than a genuine and godly spiritual power . \\nmr . darabont also overplays his hand considerably in the manipulation of our affection towards and association with his characters . \\nwas it an accidental omission that the first two inmates who walked the green mile were being punished for crimes never disclosed ? \\nby not knowing the reason for the condemned convicts\\' presence on e-block , the audience never gets the sense of the justice which is being carried out , making the death penalty appear cruel and unwarranted . \\nthis is especially true during the gruesome depiction of the second execution which was horribly botched . \\nmuch has also been made of coffey\\'s christ-like ability to heal but unlike the numerous healings which are recorded in the scriptures , coffey\\'s powers are shrouded in mystery , taking on the feel of a circus trick , coupled with a voodoo-like \" i feel your pain \" transference . \\nin contrast , there is no mystery associated with the healing that is from god . \\nthe genuine \" gifts of healing \" listed in 1 corinthians 12 is just one of the nine manifestations of holy spirit and can be operated by any spiritually instructed man or woman in accordance with the knowledge and wisdom of god . \\ntrue spiritual healing ( with few exceptions ) requires the committed believing of both the healer as well as the one being healed . \\nsuch believing comes not from the shrouded secrets of mysticism , but from the revealed word of god . \\n',\n",
       "  b' \" through a spyglass , i could see everything . \" \\nking louis xvi was beheaded on january 21 , 1793 , but instead of visualizing this act of regicide , legendary auteur eric rohmer\\'s the lady and the duke observes from afar . \\nconsider it a view to a kill made abstract . \\na proper british ( yes , british ) gentlewoman , grace elliott ( lucy russell ) , and her loyal maidservant gaze from a lofty terrace in meudon at the glistening city of paris , where raucous crowds seem tinier than ants . \\nthe maid narrates what little she sees of the execution through her telescope ( often muttering , \" i don\\'t know , \" ) as the sound of cheering patriots and revolutionaries echoes through the air . \\nwhat we don\\'t see might not be able to hurt us . \\njust close your eyes and think of england . \\nduring times of revolution , the aristocracy may feel a false sense of calm in their parlor halls , discussing tumultuous events over glasses of sherry until the walls cave in on them . \\nadapted from elliott\\'s memoirs , journal of my life during the french revolution , rohmer\\'s latest artistic tour-de-force may seem far removed from his domestic comedies ( tales of the four seasons , etc . ) , a period film set during the most violent changes in french history . \\nresisting the temptation for grand-scale theatrics , much of the lady and the duke is about quiet , decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes . \\ngrace elliott makes for an unlikely protagonist : a headstrong , snobbish blueblood , one unprepared for the machinations of history that sweep her along . \\na foreigner who accepts the french king as her own , grace\\'s life seems defined by fancy attire and lively political debate with her former lover , the king\\'s hot-blooded cousin , prince philipe , duke of orleans ( jean-claude dreyfus ) . \\nthe times are changing , though , and the gears inch ever closer toward violence . \\nduring the september massacres of 1792 , she is encountered by a procession of rioters brandishing the head of the duke\\'s sister-in-law on a stake . \\nrohmer makes a harsh transition from tranquil , old fashioned , almost stagy parlor scenes to the swell of an angry mob . \\nin doing so , he achieves what braveheart and the patriot could not : the face of death . \\nwhen grace sees her friend\\'s disembodied head on a pole , rohmer\\'s attention drifts from the societal change to one woman\\'s reaction shot , laden with hot tears . \\ngrace finds herself taking in a fugitive from justice , sheltering him from the mob . \\nthrough her relationship with the duke , she seeks a passport for this one activist\\'s escape . \\ngrace doesn\\'t even understand her own actions ( and the duke reacts in stunned disbelief at how she places herself in such danger ) . \\nshe endures persecution from robespierre and his gang of thuggish equalizers , ceaseless police monitoring , house searches , even a brief imprisonment for harmless international correspondence . \\nmaintaining her stiff upper lip and pampered life ( her imperious attitude to the servants never changes ) , she becomes a heroine through circumstance . \\nthe events themselves are intrusions upon her person , her home , and therefore her values . \\naristocracy proves a glass house , one that can barely withstand the upheaval of stones . \\nthe duke is called to vote on the king\\'s punishment , and despite his hours of deliberation with friends and advisors , talk means nothing in the face of bloody action ( or futile inaction ) . \\nthe episodic structure creates a wobbly , jarring detachment from the events of the french revolution , which serves as metaphor but also disconnects potential audience identification . \\nlazy viewers ( and critics ) may also complain that knowledge of french history is required for enjoyment of the lady and the duke . \\nthat\\'s foolery , but brings up the valid criticism that rohmer\\'s characters occasionally become didactic . \\nrohmer\\'s imperfect but assured push toward the future remains staunch and notable for casting a cautious eye upon the past while taking bold steps forward into an uncertain future . \\nwhat may arouse interest in the lady and the duke outside of foreign film enthusiasts with literary and historical passions is rohmer\\'s use of cutting edge digital technology as a means of exploring the theme of artifice as safety net or coping mechanism . \\nthe actors were filmed against a bluescreen , then placed against painted backdrops recreating the vastness of 18th century paris . \\nthis recreation calls attention to itself in every shot , a technicolor dream of fanciful buildings and wide-open streets . \\nit looks as phony as titanic , but unlike james cameron\\'s debacle , the lady and the duke plays with the notion of false security in those walls of stone . \\nwhy ?

       "  b'andrew lloyd webber\\'s musicals , preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice , present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time . \\nwebber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as \" oklahoma ! , \" or the slapstickness of shows like \" a funny thing happened on the way to the forum . \" \\nthey instead tackle hot issues from our past , and view them differently , and pack them together with redundant , catchy music , as well as thoughtful lyrics . \\nlike \" jesus christ superstar , \" which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective ( in the cool tune \" superstar , \" a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he didn\\'t spread his message wider ) , \" evita \" takes an inventive stance on its topic , this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator , juan per ? n , eva , who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention , much like the woman playing her : madonna ( although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent , among other things ) . \\n \" evita \" deals with the rise and fall of eva per ? n , a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan ( jonathan pryce ) , then died at the young age of 33 , creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di ( the two do share a bit in common , although it wasn\\'t like di slept to \" the top \" ) . \\nwebber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals , but they always have a point for doing it . \\nhere , they wish to expose her for what she is , but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks , her lying , and covering up for her fascist husband , but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions , and her death was very sad . \\nit\\'s also a musical , with almost no words not unsung . \\nthe film plays like a rock opera , much like their \" jesus christ superstar , \" with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals , even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics , which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience , but also a very entertaining one . \\nafter all , this is a musical , and webber\\'s musicals never undermine this . \\nthey are a balance of energy and intellectual depth , walking on a fine line between the both , and never stumbling on either side . \\nthis is why the beginning of \" evita \" is kind of a let-down . \\nokay , it is a let-down . \\ni\\'m not saying the opening moments are bad , because they\\'re pretty good . \\nbut what comes after is a lifeless , un-entertaining , and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer ( jimmy nail ) into taking eva to buenos aires after a one-night stand . \\nin the musical , it\\'s a fun , energetic sequence , culiminating in the show stopper , \" buenos aires , \" which is also lifeless . \\nthen a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer , instead of her leaving him , where she ends up singing the sad tune , \" another suitcase in another hall , \" which was meant for a later character , screwed over by eva . \\nthe portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft , seeming like parker and oliver stone , who adapted it for the screen , are afraid to present her for what she is , even while it\\'s being narrated by a hater of eva\\'s , the omnipotent ( antonio banderas ) , who presents her in a negative light . \\nfor a while , it looks like alan parker can\\'t pull it off . \\nhowever , the film pulls itself together in a flash , and after that song is over , and the giddily nihilistic song \" goodbye and thank you , \" where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend , is magnificent , darkly comical , and just gleeful . \\nfrom this point on , the film is hypnotic , satisfying , and satirical . \\nno more punches are thrown , and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact . \\nwe see eva woo and marry juan , get him out of jail , rise to stardom , falter a bit , come back , and then gradually die of cancer ( i think it was because of cancer ) . \\nmore importantly , many of the themes from the musical carry on with this , as well as some filling-in-the-gaps reconnassaince work . \\njuan , who is pretty underwritten in the musical , is given some extra scenes , and exposed as what he was for eva : an accessory . \\na muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan , and understand his sadness more than we did before . \\n>from the \" goodbye and thank you \" number on , the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed a nation , and saved a government , even while it left the nation\\'s people downtrodden . \\nbut despite this , the nation still loved eva , and when she slipped into death , the world mourned her because she was a star . \\nthat\\'s when our narrator , ch ? , comes out to show that she wasn\\'t the great woman she really was , and expose her fame . \\ndescribing this character is difficult , mainly because he has no real realistic background ( he\\'s said to be based on the revolutionary ch ? guevera , but the two probably could have never met , like they do in the film ) , but he serves as a perspective on eva , but even his perspective can\\'t help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death . \\nalan parker , no stranger to bizarre musicals ( he\\'s done \" fame , \" \" the committments , \" \" bugsy malone , \" and \" pink floyd the wall \" - the latter which is absolutely brilliant ) , nails the film , exposing everything for what it is . \\nwe cry for evita at the end because we feel we should , by the way it is presented . \\nhis direction is manipulative for a reason : to show the mourning for what it is . \\nand there is energy throughout , with lots of bright colors , and scenes which are cinematically entertaning , as well as enriching and deep , such as the balcony scene where she sings \" don\\'t cry for me , argentina , \" and her death sequence , which is poignant becuase of how sad it is . \\nmadonna\\'s golden globe winning performance is much like the movie : starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly , remaning there for the rest of the film . \\nat the beginning , she looks like she\\'s too busy concentrating on her singing to act , but she eventually gets it right , though never really getting the presence of , say , patti lupone ( who did the role in its american premiere back in the late 70s ) . \\nher death , though , is brilliant . \\nher singing could be better though . \\ni know she took lessons to improve her range and all , but it still sounds like she\\'s trying to hard . \\nshe sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding ( like . . . patti \\nlupone - i heard her sing on an old \" evita \" cd , and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her ) . \\nbut it\\'s generally very good , although not up to the brilliance the role really requires . \\nantonio banderas , who is almost like a guilty pleasure these days ( i\\'m one of the few people who thinks he rocks ) , is extremely comanding in his performance , presenting a lovable narrator . \\nhis singing is very good , though nothing compared to the original , mandy patinkin . \\nhe does have a pretty good singing voice , and a great range . \\nand jonathan pryce is pretty awesome , although very brief at times , in his role as juan , seeming to put on a poker face for his melancholy facade . \\nalthough it gets off to a rocky start ( \" rocky \" \\'s polite for what it really is ) , it soon picks up and becomes a wonderully poignant musical . \\nlike the other musical released in \\'96 ( woody allen\\'s \" everyone says i love you \" ) , it\\'s a reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead , but it can come back every now and then for a brief performance . \\n',\n",
       "  b'known as the most successful , highest-grossing romantic comedy in history , director garry marshall apparently struck gold with \" pretty woman , \" which opened quietly during the summer of 1990 but , thanks to positive word-of-mouth , was able to reach upwards of $175-million in theaters alone . \\nthe question of why it worked so well lies directly with the film\\'s two charismatic stars , richard gere and julia roberts , since the story itself is none too original or even believable . \\nthe other winning element that makes \" pretty woman \" so entertaining is its genuine sweetness and innocence , which is rarely as palpable in today\\'s films as it is here . \\nedward lewis ( richard gere ) is a suave , extremely wealthy business mogul who , at the start of the picture , breaks up with his girlfriend over the phone after a nasty argument , and abruptly takes his friend\\'s car and gets lost on hollywood boulevard while trying to find his hotel . \\nstopping the car along the street , he asks a woman , obviously a prostitute , for directions . \\nagreeing to get in his car and show him for ten bucks , edward ultimately accepts , they strike up a conversation , and before long she has been asked up to his penthouse room on the top floor . \\nthis meeting does not lead to sex , however , as edward confides that he\\'d rather just have someone to talk to , and offers her $300 to spend the night . \\njust as well , since the hooker , named vivian , is a beautiful , generally upbeat young woman who is the type of person that can lend an understanding ear . \\nthe meeting between these two completely opposite people does not end the next morning as planned , when edward finally offers to pay vivian three-thousand dollars if she will stay with him for six days and nights while he is in the area , keeping him company and acting as his companion to business dinners and get-togethers . \\nsince vivian firmly tells edward at the beginning that she will do anything with him except kiss him on the lips , which always leads to unwanted intimacy when dealing with her customers , the obligatory rule of the genre says that by the third act , edward and vivian will finally , truly , kiss . \\nallegedly planned as a grim , downbeat drama until garry marshall came on board as director , \" pretty woman \" has been transformed in all senses of the word into a classic fairy tale , a la \" cinderella . \" \\nthe premise is hardly believable and its portrait of prostitutes hanging out on the streets of hollywood boulevard is just about the most idealized portrayal that there could have possibly been . \\nyou honestly don\\'t need a high-iq ( or any iq , for that matter ) to guess how the film will end , and the story is as old as my great great grandma bertha . \\nthe supporting characters are almost all sketchily written and less-than-gratifying , and the screenplay is no award winner . \\nand yet , amidst all of these qualms and flaws , \" pretty woman \" is an astoundingly charming motion picture , and it is definately easy to see why it became such an overnight sensation with moviegoers . \\nyou\\'d actually be amazed how far bemusement can go , and there are a few select moments ( not even whole scenes , mind you ) that are as romantic as anything i\\'ve seen on film in the 1990\\'s . \\nadditionally , the film belongs , and its success can be attributed , to two people and two people only , and they are richard gere and julia roberts . \\nplaying sex symbols throughout the \\'80s with such pictures as \" american gigolo \" and \" an officer and a gentleman , \" gere branches out here to play a more quiet , almost shy , but still alluring , character that believably could sweep julia roberts off her feet , and vice versa . \\njulia roberts , in her breakthrough role after 1988\\'s well-received \" mistic pizza \" and 1989\\'s \" steel magnolia , \" for which she was nominated for an academy award , is radiant and funny as the wordly vivian , who surprisingly could be a role model for impressionistic viewers , not for her line of work , but more for her sheer intelligence . \\nit would have probably been easy to have written vivian as merely a flake , but screenwriter j . f . lawton clearly cared too much about his central characters to do such a thing . \\nafter \" pretty woman , \" roberts , along with meg ryan , became the reigning queen of romantic comedies ( with her latest being the just-released \" runaway bride , \" which repairs gere and roberts together once again ) , and no wonder . \\nroberts has continually proven to not only be a strong actress with a flare for comedy , but also one who can efficiently do drama , and in almost every film she appears in , it is difficult not to fall in love with her along with her male co-star . \\nan especially strong scene that gere and roberts do together takes place after edward foolishly tells one of his co-workers that vivian is actually a prostitute , and he then approaches her , making sexual advances . \\nno only does this make vivian feel cheap , especially since she had previously been posing as a more professional , eloquent young lady , but it also maddens her that edward would demean and betray her in such a way , and ultimately causes her to question where exactly her life is leading , and if she likes this particular path . \\non the more dreamy side , the film is filled with romantic scenes that are simply effervescent to behold , especially one in which edward enters into the hotel\\'s lounge to see vivian turn around and not only reveal her marvelous cocktail dress , but also her inner ( and outer ) glowing beauty . \\nanother subtle moment has vivian lovingly blowing a kiss to edward , who is asleep , and placing it on his lips , since she still is unsure if she should be getting attached to this man who may very well be out of her life forever in a short couple of days . \\n \" pretty woman \" does not blatantly step wrong until the very last scene , which is a happy ending ( as you\\'d expect , and wouldn\\'t have it any other way ) that somehow does not work , perhaps because of its undeniable contrivances . \\nthis one misstep does not put a damper on the rest of the film , though , because there is just far too much magic at work here to disaffirm such a petty problem . \\nhelped along by a warm , memorable supporting performance from laura san giacomo , as vivian\\'s best friend and roommate , and a fabulously catchy soundtrack , in which all of the

       "  b'tibet has entered the american consciousness slowly during the past few years and burst into the forefront recently . \\nthe dalai lama has made speaking tours , tibetan designs and artifacts are showing up in shops , the plight of the people has captured the imagination of major actors and artists and now there are two big budget films within as many months . \\n \" kundun \" ( \" presence \" , a name the monks call the young dalai lama ) opens in 1937 with the search for the 14th incarnation of the tibetan leader . \\na group of monks enters a village and a two-year-old child catches their attention . \\nthe young boy proves himself by identifying possessions of the previous holy man as \" mine \" . \\nhe and his family are then moved to a monastery in lhassa where he is to be prepared to take his position as the religious and political leader of the country . \\nhe is forced into difficult decisions when china invades the country in 1950 . \\nthe peaceful and isolated country is ill-equipped to fight off the intruders and diplomatic attempts over the next years yield no results . \\neventually he must make the painful choice to flee to neighboring india . \\ncomparisons to \" seven years in tibet \" are inevitable . \\nboth films cover much of the same ground although the earlier movie does so from a westerner\\'s point of view and features boxoffice draw brad pitt . \\n \" kundun \" features only native actors and is more of an insider\\'s story . \\nin some ways , this makes this film a superior concept , but it lacks the movement and spark that made \" seven years \" such an audience-pleaser . \\nthe actors contribute to the realistic feel of the movie ( filmed in morocco for obvious reasons ) . \\nthe only disappointment is chairman mao who looks like a wax dummy and moves as if he were a computer-generated character . \\non an intellectual level , it is interesting to see how two different approaches handle the same facts . \\nsome events are depicted differently and pitt\\'s austrian mountain-climber who was portrayed as a pivotal influence in the dalai lama\\'s life isn\\'t even mentioned here . \\nglossed over in \" seven years \" , the problems with the tibetan political system is hinted at here as the dalai lama muses \" we were just about to change things \" after the chinese attack . \\nthe film is magnificently beautiful thanks primarily to the cinematography of roger deakins . \\nhis lingering camera shows the exotic tibetan culture with luscious detail . \\nespecially striking is an extreme moving close up of a sand mandala grain by grain . \\nthe visual treats more than make up for the movie\\'s faults creating a poetic meditation for the audience . \\nwalking out of the theater you feel like you have awakened from a transcendental experience . \\nmartin scorsese , known for his dark tales of the underworld ( \" goodfellas \" , \" taxi driver \" , \" casino \" ) has shifted gears . \\nsomething of a thematic follow-up to his \" the last temptation of christ \" , this is his slowest film yet . \\noddly enough for a director with a history of graphic violence presenting a history filled with atrocities by the chinese , most of these events take place off-screen . \\nhis decision to not over-explain rituals is commendable . \\nthe stumbling oracle who spits out his prophecies while in a trance state is much more effective as a mystery than if we were spoon-fed interpretations . \\nphilip glass\\'s score is impressive although at times it is too overwhelming and distracting . \\ni talked to a tibetan i met outside the theater who had just seen the film and was walking back in to see it again . \\nhearing his description of how he escaped from tibet at the age of seven and how his father was one of the soldiers accompanying the dalai lama during his trip to india , i was struck by what was missing in the movie . \\nas grand as it looks and as historically accurate as it is , there is a distance between the audience and the movie . \\nthe film is more concerned with visuals and history and less so with human beings . \\nwith the exception of a few scenes , involvement with the characters is slight . \\none of those exceptions is the portrayal of the young dalai lama , shown as a mischievous boy who can\\'t resist being a kid sometimes . \\nan encounter with his older brother thubten j . norbu ( a retired indiana university professor ) who tells the young leader the chinese have ordered him to persuade him to accept communist rule or kill him is an outstanding moment , but there aren\\'t many of these . \\neven with its problems , the \" kundun \" experience is phenomenal , but one that i fear most will miss . \\nmany people who saw \" seven years in tibet \" will have a \" been there , done that \" attitude . \\nit\\'s likely that the film will miss a wide-spread appeal and public response will be the sound of one hand clapping . \\n',\n",
       "  b'wong kar-wei\\'s \" fallen angels \" is , on a purely visceral level , one of the most exciting films i\\'ve seen in a long while . \\nunfortunately , wong seems more interested in experimenting with his camera than creating tangible characters for the audience to root for . \\nordinarily , that alone would be enough to sink a movie , but in the case of \" fallen angels \" , this is not so . \\nevery shot in this film is exciting just to * look * at . \\nwong does really interesting things with the camera , but he doesn\\'t allow the pyrotechnics to completely take over , as was the case with last years dismal \" knock off \" ( which contained a shot of a foot entering a shoe . \\nugh . ) \\nthe movie follows three pairs of lost souls as they struggle to find some meaning in their lives . \\ni can\\'t say much more than that as i didn\\'t really know what was going on most of the time . \\nin fact , it wasn\\'t until about halfway through the movie that i was able to distinguish between each character . \\nthe constantly moving camera doesn\\'t really allow for the audience to associate with any one character . \\nwe\\'re always kept at a distance from these people , i suppose in order to further add to the feeling of alienation felt by the characters . \\n \" fallen angels \" is a refreshing change-of-pace from most hollywood films , which never bother to try anything different , at least on a visual level . \\nin fact , i\\'d go so far as to say that \" fallen angels \" is more challenging visually than any mainstream hollywood film i\\'ve ever seen . \\nsure , there\\'s directors like robert rodriguez who enjoy turning violence into operatic orgies of death , but to see a filmmaker like wong who actually assaults the senses with images is truly something worth celebrating . \\nbut if wong wishes to become a legendary filmmaker , he needs to work on incorporating an actual story into those awesome images . \\nthere were far too many instances during \" fallen angels \" in which i asked myself , \" now who are these people again ? \\nis this that first couple or the second couple ? \" \\nit was impossible to keep track . \\nperhaps he could let the audience know right away which character is which , by introducing them to us with \" name cards \" , as in scorsese\\'s \" mean streets \" . \\nthat\\'s really besides the point , though . \\nwong kar-wei has proven himself , through very few films , that\\'s he\\'s a movie-maker to watch . \\nlet\\'s just hope that he hones his storytelling skills with his next few movies . \\n',\n",

       "  b'14 years ago , national lampoon introduced us to a new family - the griswolds . \\nin 1983 , the griswolds embarked on a cross-country journey with the destination of wally world , a world-renowned theme park in california . \\nwe laughed our heads off as we shared the wild and crazy mishaps the family endured . \\ntwo years later , we watched again as they went to europe , and four years after that , we shared christmas with them . \\nnow , eight more years have passed , and the laughs have done more than die . \\nthey\\'ve been cremated . \\nvegas vacation brings back chevy chase as clark griswold , the good intentioned but ill-fated father of two . \\nthe premise is basically the same . \\nclark has a wonderful idea to take his family on a bonding vacation , this time to las vegas . \\nhis wife ellen ( beverly d\\'angelo ) and teenage kids rusty and audrey ( always played by different actors - this time around , by ethan embry and marisol nichols , respectively ) join him and they soon find themselves in sin city where casinos will make the backdrop for ninety minutes of slapstick . \\nof course a \" vacation \" movie wouldn\\'t be complete without good ole eddie ( reprised by randy quaid ) , the misfit cousin , showing up at all the wrong times . \\nthere isn\\'t too much of a plot here when it comes right down to it . \\nit\\'s really just a skit movie . \\nthere are a couple of ways to define a skit movie , which is not a real term as far as i know . \\nthe first would be a movie that basically has one running gag for two hours , therefore coming off like a two hour skit . \\nthe second would be a movie that seems comprised of about twenty shorter skits , each lasting about five minutes . \\nvegas vacation comes off like the first . \\na good example of the latter would be last year\\'s black sheep . \\nthe problem with this format is that it becomes old fast , and it doesn\\'t really fit into a movie mold . \\nin these cases , a \" plot \" , which is generally very thin , is used either as a shameless filler between scenes or to simply add convenience to the gags ( i . e . \\nhave a good vegas joke , make a vegas movie ) . \\nsuch is the case with this movie\\'s mini-plots . \\nclark gets gambling fever and begins spending all of the griswold\\'s money , ellen is on the verge of an affair with wayne newton ( ! ) , rusty has a fake id and is using it to his gambling advantage , and audrey is desperate for fun and winds up joining her cousin vickie ( shae d\\'lyn ) as an exotic dancer . \\nthe simple fact is : this movie isn\\'t funny . \\nat first , i did find myself chuckling heartily at a couple of little jokes , but when the movie got rolling , my interest suddenly stopped . \\nchase plays clark griswold really well . \\nhe made the character and he is the character . \\nd\\'angelo , to be quite honest , never was too impressive as ellen , and this movie doesn\\'t show any signs of redemption . \\nas for the two new griswold kids , the word \" blah \" comes to mind . \\nthe \" vacation \" series seems out to prove that anybody can play these two characters , the simple reason being that there is nothing to them . \\nthey\\'re so generic , you\\'ll expect the credits to read \" girl #1 as audrey griswold \" . \\nvegas vacation differs from the first three in the series by more than just laugh factor . \\nyes , it\\'s true that vegas vacation isn\\'t even close to being close to being as funny as the others , which were actually pretty fun in their own doofy ways , but there are a couple of other things that set this one negatively apart . \\nfirst off , why did they leave off the national lampoon\\'s heading on the title ? \\ni couldn\\'t find any reasons why , but maybe the fact is even national lampoon didn\\'t want to be associated with such a lame film . \\nthat\\'s saying a lot , especially when you look at what else the company has proudly presented : loaded weapon 1 , pcu , etc . if they expected this to be another hit , you would assume they\\'d be proud to tack on the notorious header , but for reasons only we can guess at , like the movie sucking , they didn\\'t . \\nthere is another difference here that makes an obvious impact . \\nthe first three films in the \" vacation \" series were written by john hughes , a talented writer who is behind several popular films of the 80\\'s including mr . \\nmom , sixteen candles , the breakfast club , weird science , pretty in pink , ferris bueller\\'s day off , planes , trains , and automobiles , and uncle buck . \\nwowzers ! \\nwhat a r ? sum ? ! \\nlooking at the names , you\\'d think this guy wrote everything that now stands as a movie icon for the 1980\\'s . \\nwell that\\'s not all . \\nthis guy also brought us 90\\'s hits including the home alone series , the remake of 101 dalmatians , dennis the menace , and the current flubber . \\nvegas vacation , however , didn\\'t have john hughes behind it , and the loss is very obvious . \\nthis time around , the script is in the hands of elisa bell , whose only credits thus far include four made-for-tv movies . \\nvegas vacation plays very much like one , and it would actually work much better as a made-for-tv sequel . \\nif this sounds like a wild idea , it\\'s not . \\nrevenge of the nerds third and fourth installments were both television movies , and they seemed like it . \\nvegas vacation would fit in well on the fox network as a 2 : 00 a . m . \\nsunday morning movie , but as a silver screen major motion picture , it\\'s quite out of place . \\nstephen kessler\\'s jejune direction doesn\\'t help things either . \\nhe only makes the film even more tv-movie-ish . \\neach consecutive \" vacation \" movie has suffered a drop in directing power . \\nwe started the series off with harold ramis , who also directed caddyshack and groundhog day as well as co-writing ghostbusters . \\nnot too bad . \\nthen we had national lampoon\\'s european vacation being directed by amy heckerling , who would go on to direct the hits look who\\'s talking and clueless , as well as having already directed the infamous fast times at ridgemont high . \\nlastly we had national lampoon\\'s christmas vacation , directed by jeremiah s . chechik , who went on to direct the charming benny & joon . \\nkessler , so far , has one title under his belt , the short film birch street gym , which received an oscar nomination in 1992 . \\ngranted that this was his first attempt at a feature length film , we can allow for some amateurish quality , but instead we get a movie straight from the text book - boring , bland , and deeply unoriginal . \\nif you loved the \" vacation \" movies , and i know * some * of us did , there still isn\\'t anything here worth seeing . \\nif you loved them , don\\'t ruin your good impressions of the series by indulging in this tragic example of cinema ala carte . \\nif you never did like the series , why the need to confirm why ?

       "  b'i was originally going to give the spanish prisoner two and half stars . \\nfrom my first viewing , i noticed that david mamet\\'s film was intense and clever at times but boring and cliched at other times especially at the beginning . \\nfrom my second viewing however , i noticed that mamet\\'s script was actually a masterpiece . \\nthe spanish prisoner , like the usual suspects or chinatown , begs for the viewer\\'s complete attention . \\nmiss a scene or even a small detail , and you could miss the meaning of the entire film . \\nalso like the aforementioned films , it rewards its viewer for paying attention by delivering a surprising and memorable ending . \\nmamet is success doing again what he once tackled in 1987 when he wrote and directed house of games . \\nlike his past gem , the spanish prisoner fools the audience as much ( or even more ) than the victim . \\nbecause we were deceived just like the victim , we feel a strong attachment to the main character and consequently are more interested in the film . \\nmamet has the talent of not completely ending a film gift wrapped , but rather leaving some ambiguity towards the end . \\nthe power that he has in forcing the viewer to determine who the good guys and bad guys are once the film is over , without giving a right answer , is unique and ingenious . \\nthe spanish prisoner will leave you seriously puzzled and intrigued . \\nafter seeing the film again , i noticed that the details mamet uses are so incredibly accurate it is frightening . \\nhis direction is very subtle ; as he leaves so many clues explaining what is going on and who is who but it is still very difficult to tell what exactly is happening even if you see all of them , or think you see all of them . \\nthe story follows a young up and coming businessman , joe ross , ( campbell scott ) who has just created a mysterious and lucrative \" process \" that everyone is trying to get their hands on . \\nsoon ross does not know who he can trust or who is after his \" process . \" \\nthrough his journey ross meets a number of mysterious characters : the rich and popular jimmy dell , a secretary who has a huge crush on ross , and ross\\' boss mr . klein . \\nplayed by steve martin , rebecca pidgeon , and ben gazarra respectively , the supporting cast is very solid especially martin , who deserved an oscar nomination for his commanding and manipulative role . \\nthe most interesting character in the film , though , was campbell scott\\'s joe ross . \\nthe character\\'s transformation from an ingenuous and polite rookie to a paranoid veteran is very apparent and justifiable . \\ndavid mamet\\'s script is so interesting because we know people don\\'t actually talk like the characters in the film , yet we feel so connected to some of them . \\nhis beguiling style could fool any viewer up for the challenge . \\nthis is a must see , for those interested in solving a complex puzzle of a movie . \\n',\n",
       "  b\"you may not have heard of lucas , or if you have , you might not think much of it . \\nprobably because it stars corey haim , or maybe because it's about a little geek who collects insects , or maybe because it doesn't feature slick one-liners or the chart topping soundtrack albums that were almost a requirement for teen films in the 80's . \\nhowever , you have been missing out on a true masterpeice , the best film of 1986 , and the best film about adolescent life ever made . \\ncorey haim stars as lucas bligh , a tiny 14 year old with scruffy hair , thick glasses , and an interest in insects and other outdoor life . \\none day he stops by the tennis courts and sees what must be an angel to him . \\nher name is maggie , a 16 year old who certainly is a beauty , with lovely red hair and a sweet , innocent complexion . \\nmaggie seems to be a little disturbed by this little kid watching her , but somehow he interests her , and soon they are talking and getting to know one another . \\nthey gradually become good friends , and spend the summer together doing various things , such as studying insects ( namely locusts , who come out of hiding once every 17 years ) , playing tennis , and listening to a symphony orchestra through a manhole cover . \\nlucas is obviously in love with maggie , and while she is charmed by him , it's clear that she would never consider him anything more than a very good friend . \\nthis is not clear to lucas , however . \\nhe still beleives that maggie is his soulmate , and he dreads the impending start of school because he knows what's about to happen . \\nwe soon find out why in a painful scene where lucas is humiliated by the jocks during a pep rally . \\nthey throw him on stage , right in front of his beloved maggie . \\nsurprisingly , he turns the tables on the jocks with some clowning around , but he takes it too far , and is embarassed in front of the entire school . \\nthe next scene is brilliant . \\nmaggie follows lucas outside of the pep rally . \\nshe tries to talk to him as if nothing happened . \\nhe rails back against her , in a cruel unfair fashion . \\nin lesser movies this would've turned into a confrontation between the two characters . \\nbut maggie is written smarter than that . \\nshe understands what lucas is feeling and knows exactly what to say to console him . \\nnext we are introduced to another great character named cappie ( charlie sheen ) . \\nhe is a jock with a typical cheerleader girlfriend . \\nwhat's interesting about him is that he sticks up for lucas and protects him from the other jocks . \\nof course anyone with a brain can tell what's gonna happen next . \\ncappie will cause conflict in maggie and lucas' relationship . \\nthis begins in classic scene in the school laundry room when cappie and maggie are alone . \\nshe's been assigned to show him how to operate the washer/dryer so he can clean his shirt . \\nmaggie is charmed by cappie's tender undertsanding demeanor , not to mention his shirtless body . \\nthis scene is so delicate and sweet , but cappie still has a girlfriend , preventing either one from acting on their desires . \\ndesperately trying to puncture the tension , cappie begins to kick basketballs around the room . \\nit's not long before cappie does break up with his girlfriend ( in the films only subpar scene ) . \\nlucas finally figures out what's going on when he tries to pick maggie up for the dance . \\nthis causes him to take severe actions to prove himself to maggie and himself , such as try out for the football team . \\nthe last third of the film revolves around this attempt . \\nwhile the idea seems cliched , the way it is executed is not . \\nthere are many surprises during the last half hour which lead to an ending so emotionally involving it should make the most heartless of cynics get choked up . \\ndave grusin's memorable score , played at the perfect moments , certainly helps . \\nlucas is filled with great performances . \\nforget everything you know about corey haim . \\nback in 1986 he had talent , and that is proven here as he delivers a perfect fully 3-dimensional performance filled with anger , humor , and pain . \\nkerri green is very appealing as maggie , showing us why she cares about lucas so much and why he is so attracted to her . \\nsheen's cappie is almost too good to be true , but sheen makes him beleivable , especially when he explains the reason why he protects lucas . \\nthere are other wonderful minor characters such as ciro popitti's ben , a friend of lucas , whose diminutive stature does not mean he will take crap from the jocks . \\nalso turning up in a few key scenes is winona ryder as rina , the girl who admires lucas from afar . \\nwhen people talk about the great teen angst films of the 80s , you hear john hughes this and john hughes that . \\nlucas seems to be lost among the crowd of his so-called classics . \\nbut hopefully , like with heathers and say anything , lucas can begin to find it's own loyal following and help people realize there were more to the 80s than anthony michael hall and molly ringwald . \\nit deserves more than that , but i don't want to be greedy . \\n\",\n",

\\nthe editing by steven weisberg is troubling not only considering all that could have been cut out but is also simply messy at times . \\nthe real offender here is screenwriter gerald di pego . \\nworking from a best- selling novel by nicholas sparks ( which i have not read but have been told is on the same literary level as the bridges of madison county ) , di pego creates one of the most uninspired scripts of recent times . \\nits strict adherence to clich ?

       "  b\"an american werewolf in london is john landis' groundbreaking feature about an american tourist who gets himself bitten by a werewolf in jolly old england . \\nthe groundbreaking part of the movie is the special effects . \\nmore specifically , the makeup used for the transformation of a man into a werewolf ; and for the ghosts that haunt the main character . \\neven twenty years after its release , that part of the movie is still impressive . \\nalthough , i would have to say that it really is the only part of the movie that could be considered impressive . \\nthe rest of the movie is a run of the mill werewolf flick with some extra gore thrown in for good measure . \\nif it weren't for the cutting edge makeup effects used in the werewolf transformation it is most likely that this is a film that would have gone largely unnoticed when it was released back in 1980 . \\nand with good reason -- the acting isn't great and neither is the writing . \\nwell ok , we don't actually expect either of those things to be great in a horror film . \\nbut one other important element is lacking here too -- it isn't scary . \\nwith no exception , you know what is going to happen before it happens . \\nyou don't even need the obligatory scary music to give you a hint . \\ni will give director john landis credit for this being one of the best looking horror films that i have ever seen . \\nbut john , it just wasn't scary . \\ni didn't know if this was intended to be some sort of romantic drama and the whole werewolf thing was just thrown in to get people to come to the theater to see it , but it didn't work for me . \\nactually , it was intended as a sort of a spoof on horror films . \\nbut the mix of the comedic moments with the melodrama was so bad ; the intended humor was lost on me . \\nit's never a good sign that you don't realize a movie is supposed to be funny until after the movie is long over and you read it in the background material . \\ncall me crazy , but you shouldn't have to do research on a movie to enjoy it . \\ni'm not even going to get into the plot of the movie that much , since the title pretty well sums the whole thing up . \\nwerewolf bites boy ( david naughton ) . \\nboy ends up in hospital where he is tended to and eventually falls for pretty nurse ( jenny agutter ) and then strange things begin to happen to boy . \\nincluding , and i must admit this is a very nice touch , visits from his friend who was killed in the same werewolf attack that ended up with him in the hospital . \\nthe neat thing here is that his buddy is a rapidly deteriorating corpse . \\ni know it sounds strange , but it actually works . \\nthe scenes between david naughton and the dead buddy ( griffin dunne ) are really the best parts of the movie . \\nas i said , probably the only reason that this film was a hit was because of the special effects . \\nwhile they are still impressive today , they aren't impressive enough , or plentiful enough to warrant watching this film . \\nand since they are more or less the highlight of the film , there are far better choices out there if you want a scary movie to curl up with your sweetheart to watch . \\nactually , the 1998 sequel , an american werewolf in paris , is more entertaining since it doesn't take itself as seriously and actually provides a few more laughs along the way . \\n\",\n",

       "  b'a movie like mortal kombat : annihilation works ( and must be reviewed on ) multiple levels . \\nfirst , there\\'s the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie . \\nbut occasionaly , almost as if making an ironic , self-depreciating remark , the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery . \\nno no . . . \\njust kidding . \\nhad you going there for a moment , didn\\'t i ? \\nin all seriousness however , and to be fair to the movie , it * is * necessary to provide two viewpoints : that of a movie watcher unfamiliar ( or only marginally familiar ) with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon , and that of a fan of the first movie and/or a fan of the games . \\nthe first movie ( mortal kombat ( 1995 ) ) concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth ( and it\\'s 5 billion inhabitants ) . \\nthe mortals won , and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth . \\nunfortunately , shao khan was a poor loser , and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway , ready to take over the planet , as our heroes assumed a fighting stance . \\nthe first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those ( like myself ) who are fans of the game . \\ni\\'d even go so far as to say that many folks who didn\\'t know about the game probably enjoyed the movie . \\nthe writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself , and they didn\\'t try to overachieve . \\nthere were a lot of really cool fight scenes ( with really cool accompanying music ) , intersperesed with some distracting ( but ultimately non-intrusive ) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot . \\nand , as we know , the movie was a smashing success at the box office . \\nmortal kombat : annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off , with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie . \\nshao khan has decided that he\\'s going to take over the earth * anyways * , and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament . \\nthereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused , being trite , being silly , and being just plain stupid . \\none gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought \" hey , that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movie now . \" \\ntoo bad they didn\\'t simply stick with the formula from the first movie . \\ni could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture , but here are the high points : \\n * the acting is truly bad . \\nsandra hess ( playing the sonya blade character ) is particularly execrable , especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage ( a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie ) . \\n * in one of the worst pieces of mis-casting i think i\\'ve * ever * seen , james remar plays raiden , the god of thunder . \\nin the first movie , christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke : a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics . \\ni generally like it when actors are cast against type ( tim \" tiny \" lister , jr . being cast as the president of the u . s . in the fifth element , for example ) , and remar has always been one of my favorite \" utility \" actors but he\\'s so totally wrong for this part that he doesn\\'t even have the luxury of amused self-awareness . \\n * there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important , but then never seen again . \\n * there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks , including a muddled scene where liu kang ( robin shou ) seeks out nightwolf ( litefoot ) , has a mystical hallucination , and then wanders off with jade ( irina pantaeva ) . \\nfor these reasons ( and many others ) , i can only give the movie a 2 . . . \\n . . . unless you\\'re a huge fan of the games and/or the first movie . \\nin that case , the following critiques also apply : \\n * sandra hess , while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson ( who played sonya blade in the first movie ) , is much more convincing as a fighter . \\nwilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer . \\nhess looks like she actually knows some martial arts , and puts together a much more believable fight scene . \\n * in the fights , each of the characters does at least * one * thing they do in the game ( and often more ) . \\nsonya does her \" kiss of death , \" jax does his \" earthquake , \" liu kang does his \" animality , \" and so on . \\na big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely . \\n * there aren\\'t as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first , because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between . \\nsilly , silly folks . \\nand the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mud-wrestling match . \\nlame and so obviously sexist even i ( politically incorrect , for the most part ) noticed and remarked upon it . \\n * the special effects are generally better , except for

       "  b\"after the terminally bleak reservoir dogs and the brutally violent pulp fiction , jackie brown seems like something of a light-hearted departure for quentin tarantino . \\nit's more of a ho-hum heist story with characters that speak the tarantino language . \\nluckily , his showcase of actors convert every morsel of possible enjoyment onto the screen , and jackie brown has no trouble entertaining the average viewer . \\nthe story introduces us to a street-wise black woman named jackie brown ( pam grier ) , a flight attendant who smuggles money and drugs from one destination to another . \\nshe works for a bottom-of-the-barrel airline and receives a minimal salary . \\nbut one day , she is picked up by a pair of federal officials ( including michael keaton as the tough-nosed ray nicolet ) , and found with a handsome load of cash and a small bag of smuggled dope . \\njackie is working for a weapons dealer named ordell ( samuel l . jackson ) , who pays her bail money but suspects her of tipping off the feds about their operation . \\nsoon jackie and ordell are plotting a way to smuggle $500 , 000 through to them under nicolet's nose , with the help of ordell's oaf of a partner ( robert de niro ) and drugged-out lady friend ( bridget fonda ) . \\nalso entering the picture is a bail-bondsman named max cherry ( robert forster ) , who takes a liking to jackie and agrees at one point to make the situation even more complicated ( how i won't say ) . \\nthe big drop-off is undoubtedly the high point of jackie brown , in which numerous double-crosses take place and many clothing store bags ( filled with cash ) switch hands . \\nit's unfortunate that tarantino takes his sweet time getting there , and doesn't offer anything extremely compelling while doing so . \\nthere are , as always , amusing exchanges between characters . \\nthe funniest repartee is between de niro and fonda , as he becomes annoyed with her constant bickering while making fun of his iq , or lack thereof . \\nthe most interesting relationship is between max and jackie . \\na 56-year old white bail bondsman and a 44-year old black flight attendant with believable chemistry ? \\nyou've got to commend the acting . \\njackie brown is a seriously dragged-out exercise enlivened by such fine acting . \\nthe film clocks in at a lengthy 2 hours , 35 minutes . \\ntarantino's talky style manages to hold your attention heavily , but there are more than a few dramatic lapses and crucial lulls in the storyline . \\nalso , fans of the director should be prepared for a lighter side to appear . \\njackie brown has four major shootings , and two of those take place mostly off-screen , so don't be expecting a typical tarantino bloodbath . \\nyou can expect frequent foul language , mostly coming way of ordell , who ( much to the dismay of spike lee ) uses the `n' word as part of his regular vocabulary . \\nthe acting is the glue that holds everything together . \\ngrier , making a sudden comeback from her reign in the 1970's , is more than adequate for the title character . \\nin fact , she's flat-out great . \\nanother comeback comes from former tv star robert forster , who does a grand job as max cherry , and is perfectly cast in doing so . \\nmichael keaton makes his presence felt , albeit in small but dignified moments , and de niro is ideal in playing the lug-head who goes over the edge . \\nspeaking of that , bridget fonda has relatively little to do as ordell's bikini-clad beach babe , and yet she manages to look fairly occupied . \\nthere's not a single sign of misplaced dialogue or snubbed line throughout the entire movie . \\nwhich is a life-saver for mr . tarantino . \\nthe story barely holds together in the meantime , and we merely get a small tremor whenever there should be a defeaning earthquake . \\nbut oh well . \\njackie brown manages to be an enjoyable detour from quentin tarantino , even if it is lacking the glaring and original bite of his previous work . \\nlet's just hope that the director hasn't gone soft on us . \\n\",\n",
       "  b\"it used to be that not just anyone could become a vampire . \\nusually , you had to be an aristocrat - a count such as dracula or karnstein . \\nto qualify , you'd have to have a modicum of sophistication , so you'd at least look cool - or suave - when biting into some young damsel's throat . \\nbut today , in our overly politically correct world , any scuzzy-looking , long-haired , unshaven lout or any spiked-haired harridans can put the bite on you . \\nby the same token , to be a vampire hunter , one had to have some sort of medical training and knowledge of the occult or maybe perhaps be some sort of professional soldier , or at least one who retired with honors . \\nnot in these times . \\nall you need are some sharp weapons , some bullets forged from silver and any yahoo can be a buffy - or a blade . \\nwithout sounding elitist , the fear of vampires has greatly diminished because of this lack of exclusivity . \\nwhich brings us to blade , the latest in a long line of vampire movies in which , it seems , half the population is putting the bite on the other half . \\nnot only are there thousands of vampires , but they seem to move from city to city , pay off police departments and , most importantly , establish their own exclusive after-hours raves in which the highlight is the sprinkler system going off and dousing all the occupants in a blood shower . \\nwith all that blood , you wonder why they have to hunt for victims . \\nyou also wonder when they get the time to get their clothes dry-cleaned and why no cleaner ever complains about all the bloodstains . \\nblade , which is based on a marvel comic book character , is , like a comic book , all visual . \\nthe plot is basically blade repetitiously slashing his way through the vampire army seeking their leader , deacon frost . \\nit's all hokum and nonsense , of course . \\nbut the filmmakers play it straight . \\nunfortunately , at least at the advance screening i attended , the audience didn't see it that way and laughed through much of the proceedings . \\nyou know a movie is in trouble when the scenes of blood and gore that should elicit screams of fright instead evoke peels of laughter . \\nanother tell-tale sign is when the audience seems to be admiring the hero's costume more than the hero . \\nalso it seems it's not enough for today's vampire merely to have fangs . \\nhe must also be proficient in the martial arts . \\nwhy a supernatural being , one of the undead , needs such skills is beyond me . \\n ( of course , this concept dates to the 1974 hammer films-run run shaw production of legend of the seven golden vampires , in which dracula is defeated by seven karate-chopping siblings . ) \\nwesley snipes is buff as blade . \\nhe growls his lines -the few he has - and spends most of the time glowering - as if he was suffering from indigestion or having second thoughts about starring in and co-producing this turkey . \\nblade is just another example of how the vampire film , a once honorable member of the horror family , has gone downhill . \\nthis dud mostly makes you yearn for those quaint old days when christopher lee could be stopped just by dangling a crucifix in his face . \\ntoday's vampires lack the panache , the style of a bela lugosi or a christopher lee . \\nthey are not even worthy enough to carry those great bloodsuckers' capes . \\nthey are more farcical than frightful . \\nthis whole enterprise is one dull blade that could have used lots of sharpening . \\n\",\n",
       "  b\"the blues brothers was a wonderful film , a hilarious comedy packed with good music . \\nit cried out for a sequel , but john belushi's untimely death seemed to eliminate the idea . \\nhowever , eighteen years have passed , and the long dormant sequel has finally emerged . \\nunfortunately , it's a sequel not worthy of the original . \\nthe film starts exactly eighteen years after the first one ended . \\nelwood blues ( dan aykroyd ) is just getting out of jail , his brother jake having recently died . \\nas in the first film , he first visits mother mary stigmata ( kathleen freeman ) and then sets about getting the band back together . \\njohn belushi's absence leaves a terrible hole in the film , and although three new characters are created to fill the void , it is still very noticeable . \\nfirst , there's cabel ( joe morton ) the illegitimate son of elwood's stepfather ( played by cab calloway in the first movie ) . \\ncabel is reluctant to join his destiny , and spends most of the movie as an illinois sheriff , chasing the blues brothers band . \\nnext , there's mighty mack ( john goodman ) , a bartender who becomes the new lead singer of the band . \\nfinally , there's buster ( j . \\nevan bonifant ) , a ten year old orphan who tags along with elwood and eventually joins the band . \\nthe plotting of the film is hardly original . . . it \\nseems to be almost a clone of the original . \\nelwood has to go to reluctantly retrieve each member of the band , they then travel , while being pursued by the police , and perform at several odd stops until they finally reach the big concert finale . \\nthe first film had neo-nazis as the random element , this time around , the russian mafia and a militia group fill their role . \\nin fact , the duplication of the plot is so ridiculously complete that certain scenes are practically identical to the original . \\nremember the classic performance at country bob's ( where they like both types of music : country and western ) from the first movie ? \\nwell , this movie has a performance at a country fair , where the band is expected to play bluegrass music . \\nthere's the massive police car pileup , although this time the gag falls completely flat . \\nthere's even an exact replica of the conversion scene in the church of reverend cleophus ( james brown ) . \\nthere are plenty of recurring characters too . \\nin addition to mother stigmata and reverend cleophus , aretha franklin reprises her role as mrs . murphy . \\nfrank oz , a prison guard in the first film , makes an appearance here as the prison warden . \\nas the stars , the new blues brothers don't live up to their legacy . \\naykroyd is more loquacious , yet much flatter as elwood . \\njohn goodman barely has a character as mighty mack . \\njoe morton has the deepest character , but not a terribly interesting one , as cab . \\nand what's the deal with the orphan ? \\nit plays like a desperate gimmick that doesn't mesh at all with the rest of the film . \\nat least bonifant isn't as precocious as he could have been in the role . \\nbut the true star , and the only saving grace , of the film is the music . \\nand the film is packed with it ( even during and after the ending credits ) . \\nalthough there are no brilliant mergers of comedy and song as in the original's rawhide/stand by your man medley , the music is very much enjoyable . \\nto top it off , the film is packed to the gills with cameo musician appearances . \\nb . b . king , blues traveler , eric clapton , travis tritt , wilson pickett , erykah badu , bo diddley and steve winwood are just a sampling of the multitude of stars that make an appearance here and there . \\nunfortunately , the music pauses here and there to allow in the familiar plot . \\nif simply copying the original blues brothers wasn't bad enough , writers aykroyd and john landis dumb it down , removing any memorable characters , and replacing them with flashy , but unbelievable , magical gimmicks . \\nit's a shame . \\nbuy the soundtrack and avoid the film . \\nbetter yet , rewatch the original . . . you'll \\nhave a much better time . \\n\",\n",

       "  b' \" the tailor of panama \" is a different kind of spy movie . \\ndespite the presence of pierce brosnan , there is nary a hint of james bond flash here . \\ninstead of big action scenes , leering super villains and empty-headed femme fatales , we get interesting characters and an intriguing situation . \\nbased on the novel by john le carr ? , who also co-wrote the screenplay , the film offers viewers something rarely seen in theaters this time of year : a solid , well-told story . \\nbrosnan plays andy osnard , a british operative walking on thin ice . \\nhis british superiors ship him off to panama , making sure he understands that he had better not screw up the placement . \\nosnard arrives in the tropics virtually oozing contempt for his new co-workers and his new home base . \\nwhen shown the bridge of the americas by a person marveling over the fact that , since the creation of the panama canal , the structure is the sole connection between north and south america , he barely keeps from yawning . \\nbrosnan clearly relishes the chance to be the antithesis of 007 , investing the suave spy with a distinct reptilian quality coupled with an air of indifference that irks his fellows to no end . \\nsearching for a way to get information on the government , osnard sets his sights on harry pendel ( geoffrey rush ) , an unctuous tailor serving the panamanian elite . \\nharry claims to be a transplant from britain\\'s renowned saville row , but osnard knows his secret : the tailor is an ex-con who served five years in prison after torching his uncle\\'s shop in an insurance scam . \\nhe also knows that harry is up to his ears in debt , having spent a fortune on an unsuccessful farm . \\nosnard offers harry a way out . \\nhe will pay for information harry has gathered from his upscale clientele . \\neager to comply , harry offers what he knows , then starts concocting tidbits to keep the money flowing . \\nbefore long , he is forced to spy on his loving wife , louisa ( jamie lee curtis ) , an aide to the canal director . \\nharry\\'s little lies build , eventually taking on a life of their own . \\nosnard turns in reports about the \" silent opposition , \" a group threatening to upset the balance of control over the canal . \\nthe bogus revelation proves explosive , leading to meetings in washington d . c . over how to best protect the vital waterway . \\nmeanwhile , osnard wallows in his newfound status , enjoying the best the city has to offer and wooing an attractive co-worker . \\nand harry grows ever more fretful , fearing the consequences if his clients , not to mention his wife , learn about his lies . \\ngeoffrey rush is wonderful as harry , fawning over his customers by day and savoring his rich family life in the evenings , all while playing secret agent in the off hours with his new benefactor . \\nrush makes harry a credible figure , presenting the various levels of the character so effectively that he remains sympathetic despite his duplicity . \\nafter gaining fame playing larger than life characters , rush flips everything around for this role , using his energy to depict the quiet desperation of a man slowly realizing that the solution to his troubles may be worse than the original problems . \\nalthough she gets far too little screen time , jamie lee curtis imbues louisa with a depth greater than the screenplay provides her . \\nof the central characters , she is the only one that exhibits maturity and genuine self-confidence . \\ncurtis is one of my favorite female actors ; whiplash smart , sultry and charismatic , she deserves more than supporting roles . \\nspeaking of supporting characters , there are some great ones here . \\nharold pinter is amusing as harry\\'s uncle benny , who pops up throughout the story in a number of creative ways . \\nalso shoring up the proceedings is jon polito as a corrupt banker and dylan baker , who is a riot as a united states general straight out of the dr . strangelove school of armed patriotism . \\nbut the most important secondary performers are leonor varela and brendan gleeson , both outstanding as two wounded activists . \\ntheir presence adds weight to the story , reminding us that beyond the charades of the leading men , there are real people that have suffered greatly over the politics connected to the canal . \\ndirector john boorman adds additional verisimilitude by shooting the film on location . \\ninstead of using panama city merely as a colorful backdrop , he adroitly weaves in footage of all aspects of life there . \\nthe metropolis , described by one character as \" casablanca without heroes \" pulsates with life , underling the folly of the two foreigners playing dangerous games that could have a disastrous impact on a great many people . \\n \" the tailor of panama \" succeeds because the principals behind it were bright enough to make it more than a simple entertainment . \\n',\n",

in the first movie the people looked just like the toys , but now human skin looks soft and has a slight bluish tint . \\nwe can also see that bo peep is porcelain . \\nas you can tell from the long-winded phrasing common in the merchandising -- \" disney and pixar\\'s \\'toy story 2\\' \" -- this is pixar\\'s coming out party . \\nto celebrate they appended their first project , a hilarious short about two desklamps and a rubber ball , to the beginning of the movie . \\nthey made the short in 1986 , which is incredible when one considers the relatively primitive level of computer technology available then . \\non the downside , \" toy story 2 \" follows the formula of the original so closely that the sequel comes off a bit stale , and some sections tend to drag . \\noverall , though , i had a great time and found \" story 2 \" to be a worthy successor to the first \" toy story . \" \\nbottom line : this one really is fun for the whole family ! \\n',\n",

\\nyes . \\ndoes it matter ? \\nnot really . \\nthe film opens in october of 1969 . \\nfirefighter frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job , then goes home to his loving wife julia ( elizabeth mitchell ) and son johnny ( daniel henson ) . \\nthe double-pronged story flashes forward to 1999 , where johnny ( now jim caviezel ) is all grown up and working as a police detective . \\na strange occurrence -- the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city -- allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in \\'69 and that john has found in the present day . \\nthough both are initially skeptical of the idea , john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire , and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom . \\nnow flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive , john is initially overjoyed , until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous : a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women . \\nfrank and john now must work together to set things right , with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past . \\nthe premise of \" frequency \" is unusual , and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept : john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions . \\nthis isn\\'t explained ; you just have to go with it . \\nwhen frank doesn\\'t die in a fire , john is the only one who remembers it differently , while everyone else remembers it the new way . \\nthe concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities -- 1969 and 1999 -- are to each other . \\nsometimes frank\\'s changing the past results in something happening right away in john\\'s world , and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time . \\nnow , the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this , and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted ( but nevertheless logical ) if i thought about it hard enough ( for example , the reason john gets advance information of the serial killer\\'s murders was because the change had already happened in frank\\'s world , and john is only witnessing the * projection * of that change ) , but explanations aren\\'t really the point . \\nwhen \" frequency \" gets cooking , it\\'s a riveting little thriller , even if it is confusing . \\nwhat matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment , and \" frequency \" works as long as it keeps moving . \\nthe film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion . \\ndirector gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure \" frequency \" as good hollywood entertainment , establishing decent , likable characters , making us care for them , and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved . \\ni liked many of the creative touches : the split screens , allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities , and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward . \\nit actually uses the 1969 mets-orioles world series ( the one that featured the amazin\\' mets ) to great effect -- frank uses john\\'s advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him . \\n ( admittedly , this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself . ) \\ni even liked the final scene , which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods . \\nsome may find this scene blindingly confusing , as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious , but it does make sense if you think about it ( and give the script a lot of leeway ) , and let\\'s face it : it\\'s a darn cool way to end the film . \\nthere are enough surprises and plot twists in \" frequency \" to keep you on your toes , and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant . \\nthe other major thing to appreciate about \" frequency \" is the handling of the father-son relationship . \\nquaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily ; it\\'s a rock-solid job from both actors . \\nthe relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept : how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative , or with a future descendant ? \\nwatching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question . \\nthe credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film ; if we don\\'t believe in the characters , we don\\'t care about the outcome of the thriller plot . \\nhere , we do care , because we like the lead actors . \\ni also liked some of the supporting cast members . \\nelizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles , playing julia the doting wife * and * mother , but still performs admirably . \\nandre braugher , late of the television show \" homicide : life on the street , \" gives a nice supporting turn as frank\\'s best friend and future colleague of john . \\nhe has a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while frank\\'s world series predictions come true before his very eyes . \\nbraugher strikes the perfect facial expression here , simultaneously dismayed and amused . \\nperhaps the only thing i didn\\'t like about \" frequency \" is the overly sentimental coda , during which the camera\\'s focus goes a little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard . \\nbut that\\'s only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics . \\ni freely acknowledge that \" frequency \" may best work as a \" guy \" movie , since it focuses on the very male-oriented idea of father-son relationships ( echoes of \" field of dreams \" can be easily heard ) , but the underlying concept is universally applicable . \\nwho wouldn\\'t want to speak with a long-dead parent ? \\nor see how their children turn out ? \\n \" tell me about your life , son \" -- excuse me while i mist up . \\nand don\\'t call me a sissy . \\n',\n",
       "  b'if the current trends of hollywood filmmaking continue , we are probably five or six years away from the moment when the 1980s would become the next golden age of movie nostalgia . \\nalthough some hollywood products already use the last decade as a background for their stories ( mostly in ironic way , like grosse pointe blank and romy & michelle\\'s high school reunion ) , some time should pass before the good memories of that era overcome the bad ones . \\nuntil that happens , 1980s would be remembered as the decade of greed , when the revolutionary ideals of 1960s turned into its cruel , materialistic opposite and the money became the only thing that matters . \\ncontemporary movies are good in illustrating what was bad for the people who had to live in those times . \\none of such movies , one that probably brings the essence of 1980s to the screen , is william friedkin\\'s to live and die in l . a . \\nthe money isn\\'t just the symbolic motive in the film , it is the major elements of the plot . \\nrick masters ( willem dafoe ) is an ex-convict who used his artistic abilities in order to become one of the best counterfeiters in l . a . being too intelligent to fall into police traps , and ruthless enough to eliminate anybody or anything that could jeopardise his career , masters managed to elude law for years and became well- connected . \\nrichard chance ( william l . petersen ) is a secret service agent , adrenaline junkie whose life gets new meaning after his partner got killed by masters . \\nhowever , his plans of bringing the counterfeiter down meet one obstacle after another . \\nfinally he sets up a final sting , but his superiors deny him the necessary money . \\nbeing frustrated , and against the reluctance of his new partner john vukovich ( bill pankow ) , he decides to get the money by robbing underworld courier . \\ntheir plan backfires with almost tragic consequences when their target turns out to be undercover fbi agent , but chance decides to carry out his scheme anyway . \\nlike french connection , one of his previous masterpieces , this friedkin\\'s movie was inspired by real life . \\ngerrald petievich , author of the novel that later served as basis for his screenplay , spent many years working as a secret service agent . \\nthat turned to be useful for the portrayal of that law enforcement agency , not much utilised by hollywood . \\nsecret service millieu was also cleverly used in order to bring the viewer into the decade of greed ; the beginning scene where the movie\\'s hero works as a part of presidential security detail is a nice opportunity to hear reagan\\'s speech that could illustrate the political and economical notions of those times . \\nultramaterialistic and egotistical view of the world is shared by almost any character in the movie . \\nwillem dafoe brilliantly portrays dangerous and intelligent psychopath , whose ruthlessness and lack of any moral fibber doesn\\'t seem like affliction in the reagan years ; on the contrary , those qualities actually makes masters socially acceptable . \\ncompared with him , and all the other side characters that want their \" piece of the action \" , two heroes on the side of law seem like losers . \\ninstead of being a classical good guy , secret service agent richard chance ( portrayed by william petersen in his most impressive role so far ) is nothing more than a lunatic whose adrenaline addiction and madness work against his better judgement ; his sidekick , who should serve as those \" better judgement \" is a weakling and sentimental fool that gets suckered in the end . \\nin such surroundings of moral decay , the not so happy , yet surprising ending doesn\\'t seem out of line ( although the very last shot leaves too much questions unanswered ) . \\nthe dark atmosphere of l . a . - city of glamour and moral decay - is nicely captured by william friedkin\\'s directing skills . \\nthe tight and realistic scripts with memorable characters ( portrayed by such capable actors like john turturro , dean stockwell , debra feuer , darlanne fleugel and steve james ) gave opportunity for friedkin to use another gimmick that made him famous in his 1971 masterpiece - great car chase . \\nthat scene alone , with lot of realism , thrills and surprise twists , is worth seeing the rest of the film . \\nthe soundtrack , provided by now almost forgotten band \" wang chung \" , is also one of the more memorable of that decade . \\nin every case , to live and die in l . a . is one of the rare movies in which hollywood actually tries to tell some unflattering truths about the world and succeeds in it . \\n',\n",
       "  b'there is a scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of a courtroom , surrounded by people who are giving him a lively standing ovation because of his strong-worded attack on a group of stoic doctors . \\nwhen i noticed that the audience with whom i saw this film was reacting the same way , i realized that i was going to have a hard time finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture . \\nyou see , patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries . \\ni hated this movie for every second that i sat watching it , and i actively hate it now , days later , with the simpering , superficial , nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories . \\ni hate every element of the film , beginning with tom shadyac\\'s shameless direction , and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey . \\nthe badness of patch adams is stupefying . \\nit\\'s confounding . \\ni can\\'t believe a film can be this bad . \\nand yet , it\\'s based on a real man who probably has a good point to make . \\nin the film , patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams , in a performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that i wonder now if he is even human . \\nin the beginning of the film , patch commits himself to a mental institution because he doesn\\'t want to kill himself . \\nwhile there , he notices that the doctors don\\'t care about the patients , and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings . \\nso , patch goes on a crusade to be a great doctor who actually talks to his patients . \\nhe goes to medical school , where he meets truman ( daniel london ) and convinces him that it\\'s good to help people . \\nhe also meets carin fischer ( monica potters ) , the anti-male med student who just wants to go through the motions and be a successful doctor . \\nnaturally , the dean of the medical school ( bob gunton ) hates patch , and wants to thwart his plans , even though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams . \\nso patch decides that he\\'s going to build a free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have . \\nand that , my friends , is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998 . \\non a superficial level , the film is not particularly bad : i wouldn\\'t say the cinematography bothered me , and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for ( i actually liked potter\\'s performance , even if she is wasted ) . \\nbut the film fails fundamentally in execution . \\nevery scene swells with grand , \" emotional \" music , played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard . \\ntake , for instance , the first scene , which shows patch sitting on a bus . \\nwe don\\'t know patch yet , but there\\'s sad music , and it\\'s supposed to make us really sad that he\\'s sad . \\nlater on , patch makes a lot of progress : he helps a dying patient ( peter coyote ) to enjoy the last days of his life , and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively . \\nand when that patient finally dies ( spoiler alert ! ) , the music is very very sad . \\nbut the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions . \\nreal drama is character-based . \\nyou grow to like someone , and then something bad happens , and you feel it . \\nwe don\\'t ever grow to know the dying patient ; he\\'s simply a vehicle for patch\\'s greatness . \\nreal drama doesn\\'t seem forced , or present just to make the audience cry . \\nthat\\'s why patch adams is not real drama . \\nit goes for every cheap tear imaginable , wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene . \\neven scenes that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaiman\\'s sickening musical score . \\nsentimentality like this is indeed bad . \\nbut it\\'s not as bad as half-baked , simplistic themes . \\nyou see , patch is a really great student . \\nhe aces his tests without studying , and does it so effectively that people think he\\'s cheating . \\nbut patch doesn\\'t think that memorizing facts is the way to become a good doctor . \\n \" why don\\'t we see patients until the third year ? \" he bursts out every three seconds . \\nwell , patch , that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients . \\nnot everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort . \\nmost of us have to study . \\nand a doctor who really wants to help , but doesn\\'t know a toe from a finger , probably won\\'t be too successful in preventing death . \\noh wait , i almost forgot : the point of doctors is not just to \" prevent death , \" but to \" improve the quality of life ! \" \\nyes ! \\nthat is true ! \\nand you can not do that without studying . \\nyou can not do that without going to medical school . \\nwhat patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe , just maybe , it is a good idea to study first and talk to patients later . \\nfollow the rules ? \\nbah ! \\nwho needs the rules ! \\nonly uptight doctors follow the rules . \\nthe real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants . \\nand then there\\'s the free clinic issue , which i find shockingly , frighteningly idealistic . \\na free clinic . \\nin the middle of the forest . \\nwhere patients can be taken to be helped . \\nfor free . \\nhow will patients be transported to the free clinic ? \\nwill it have an emergency room ? \\nor is it just for mental patients ? \\nand who , may i ask , will pay for it ? \\nthe film does give some token attempts to question patch\\'s motives ( i think another character asks him how he\\'s going to pay for it , in addition to a little bit of meaningless blather about hmos and medical insurance ) , but they certainly don\\'t explore or challenge patch\\'s ideas to any meaningful extent . \\nreader , please understand this : i am not making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams . \\ni know nothing about him . \\nif his beliefs mirror those of this film character , then i might like to have an intelligent discussion with him about them . \\nbut regardless of what the real patch adams believes , the themes put forth in this film are simplistic and phony . \\nand in the last scene , the big , obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus , patch does a lot of shouting . \\nactually , robin williams does a lot of shouting . \\nhe shouts a lot about helping people , and a lot of people cry because they are moved by his words . \\ni won\\'t tell you that you can\\'t be moved by his words , because i , too , was moved by his words . \\ni was moved in such a profoundly negative way that i was reminded of how cheap and phony a cinematic experience can be . \\npatch adams is the cheapest of them all . \\n',\n",

       "  b'the event of events is upon us . \\npeople have waited twenty-two years for the prequel to star wars and die-hard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it . \\ni don\\'t think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has caused . \\nit is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history . \\nanyone who tells you \" it\\'s just a movie \" is either lying or clueless . \\nit is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic . \\nthe second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz ( which is far too weak a word ) that star wars epsode i : the phantom menace so effortlessly generated . \\nbut that does not mean that the film itself is bad . \\nin fact , it is terrific . \\ni strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash . \\nit is set some decades before the events of the original 1977 star wars took place . \\nthe film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging : the trade federation , angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small , peaceful planet of naboo . \\nthe republic sent two jedi knights ( people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as \" the force \" ) , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) to negotiate . \\nunable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur , the jedi and the queen of naboo ( natalie portman ) escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene . \\non the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine , where they meet the movie\\'s real focal point , young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) . \\nhe is an innocent slave boy , but \" the force is strong with him \" so qui- gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as a jedi . \\nas any self-respecting star wars fan should know , anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker . \\n>from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actor\\'s movie . \\naround 70% of the characters , if not more , are computer generated in one form or another , and though the effects are seamless , the movie lacks soul . \\ni think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade , cinema should still be a human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this . \\nthis is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far , with plenty of broad comic relief to go around , much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jar-jar binks . \\nhe\\'s essentially a computer-animated sidekick who says things like \" exqueeze me ? \" \\nand \" mesa go now , okeday ? \" , and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying . \\nthe visual effects are astounding ( although director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them ) and the movie is a thrilling triumph . \\nif it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through imagination and excitement . \\nthe climactic lightsaber battle ( oh , come on , as if you didn\\'t already know ) , among other things , is outrageously entertaining and defines the term \" popcorn movie \" . \\nwhat made me surrender and give this movie * * * 1/2 stars was the score by john williams . \\neven though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes out these days , his work here is nothing short of brilliant . \\nhis use of opera during the climax really does add a punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling . \\nthe phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia . \\nwhen you see \" a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away \" , when the familiar music plays , when the words \" star wars \" appear on screen , you\\'ll feel a tingle even if you didn\\'t see the movie when it first came out in \\'77 . \\nit feels oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin , a boy whose innocence , we know , will be taken away and who will soon cross over to the dark side . \\nit is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the jedi masters aspire to get him trained in the jedi arts ; we know that it will do more harm than good , but they do not . \\nwe not only feel more involved in the story , but we feel like we\\'re seeing the beginning of a saga that we have cherished for years . \\nthe phantom menace , although lacking in human aspects of the story , is a very worthy installment in the star wars . \\nit works as an action flick , visually eye-popping and often paralyzingly exciting ; it also works as an elicitor of memories , a piece of exquisite nostalgia . \\n ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; \\n',\n",
       "  b'i must admit that i was a tad skeptical of \" good will hunting \" , based both on the previews and the first fifteen minutes of the film , in which the main character will hunting ( matt damon ) , an mit janitor in his early twenties , is discovered to be an einstein-level closet genius when he solves two extraordinarily difficult math problems overnight . \\nthe only problem is that will is a tough street kid who\\'s had his share of run-ins with the law , and before long he\\'s being hauled in for assault after a parking lot fight . \\nprofessor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) , who had brought up the math problems in his lectures , tracks him down and strikes a deal with the police : will is to be released , provided he works with lambeau on his math research regularly and attends therapy sessions . \\nthis sounds like the formula for mildly charming fluff , but \" good will hunting \" rises above its fairly mundane premise to deliver a poignant and clever drama . \\na conflict gradually emerges between lambeau and will\\'s therapist sean mcguire ( robin williams ) - lambeau wants to get will to use his brain , while sean wants him to listen to his heart , both of which he has been largely neglecting . \\nwill finds that the former is much easier than the latter , so much so , in fact , that he gets bored with it and grows increasingly resistant to lambeau\\'s attempts to recruit him into the academic lifestyle . \\nhe also has his share of problems with his girlfriend skylar ( minnie driver ) , an mit student who is moving to california at the end of the school year and would like a reluctant will to come with her . \\nwhat makes \" good will hunting \" work so well , aside from the strong performances ( especially from damon and williams ) , is the depth of characterization and the representation of the conflicts in will\\'s life . \\nthe script\\'s sympathies seem to lie more with sean mcguire than with lambeau , but neither of them is presented as completely right or wrong . \\nlambeau , while he may seem a little cold at times , is still written well enough that we like him as a character even when we\\'re not sure if we like what he has to say . \\nand sean , for all his warm-heartedness , has , as lambeau and later will point out , not lived up to his full intellectual potential either ; the therapy sessions turn out to be just as revelatory for sean as they do for will . \\nwill\\'s reaction to this situation , and the way in which he slowly becomes more receptive to skylar and to sean , is presented in a believable fashion and in a way that forces the audience to consider all the characters\\' opinions , rather than setting up an obvious \" right \" and \" wrong \" side and beating them over the head with it . \\nfor a film with such an extraordinary character , \" good will hunting \" presents itself as remarkably ordinary ; it achieves the difficult task of making the next albert einstein into an everyman , a character to whom the audience can easily relate and who must make choices similar to those that almost everyone faces at one time or another . \\nthis film gives us real drama when it so easily could have given us merely melodrama , by having the government kidnap will to use him in covert spy missions or introducing some other equally far-fetched situation . \\n \" good will hunting \" also has its share of fun humor , such as when will , in an early therapy session , pretends to be hypnotized and smoothly parodies the alien abduction scenarios that have become so well known in popular culture . \\nand in the one scene in which government agents do in fact appear , will blows them off with a hilariously scathing accusation of human rights violations in africa . \\nwill\\'s relationship with his friends , most notably chucky ( ben affleck ) , is usually rather amusing , if somewhat crude ( the film has 100+ uses of the \\'f\\' word , which was most likely the reason for its r-rating ) , and lends itself well to the development of will\\'s character . \\nadd all this to the fact that \" good will hunting \" even manages to pull off an uplifting happy ending without getting excessively sentimental , and you might be wondering why i haven\\'t given this film four stars . \\nwell , for one thing , no matter how well damon and affleck , who wrote the screenplay , and director gus van sant pull it off , the story is still rather contrived and not particularly original . \\nthere are also a few scenes that did feel a bit formulaic , including one that was supposed to be emotional but really just seemed like the obligatory crying scene for any movie involving therapy sessions . \\nstill , \" good will hunting \" takes its premise a lot farther than i thought it would , and is definitely one of the better personal dramas i have seen in the last few years , and as of right now it stands as one of the top five on my list of \\'97 films . \\n',\n",

       "  b'\\'pleasantville\\' ( 1998 ) taps into hollywood\\'s lack of integrity with subtle messages that can be easily missed \\n ( www . pleasantville . com ) april 2 , 1999 ( friday ) \\ncast : tobey maguire , reese witherspoon , william h . macy , joan allen , j . t . \\nwalsh , jeff daniels \\nmpaa rating : pg-13 for sexual content and thematic elements \\ngenre : drama \\nin my opinion : \\nin short : it takes a lot of careful observation to see the true morals and lessons brought out in this film ; one can easily be misled as to what the real message is . \\nreview : in a literally colorless world with an almost mechanical population , there is no room for transitioning variety or even the customary happenings of everyday life , such as rain , fire , or emotions . \\nthe town of pleasantville has one adjective : pleasant . \\nthere is no sadness , no fear , no danger , no discomfort , no love , and no hate . \\nput simply , it\\'s a place alanis morissette could really work wonders for . \\nj one big note however is that it is only a 50\\'s sitcom that airs in reruns on an \" oldies \" tv station ? or is it ? \\ni had waited months to see this movie and after doing so on opening day i was not disappointed . \\ni found it quite intriguing and delightful and went back 3 more times in the period it endured at the box office . \\nbut it wasn\\'t until months later , when i slipped in for a small showing in one of those crummy \" dollar theaters \" after not having seen it for so long , that my eyes were opened to such a deeper meaning and perspective than i had previously experienced . \\nit is a far too feasible misconception that this is a film which forwards the idea that a world without some \" healthy \" immorality is not a world at all . \\ninstead , the actual message , which so far has not been recognized by many viewers that i know of , is that a world without immorality doesn\\'t give one the ability to discern right and wrong for himself , because everything is automatically right . \\nthere is no room for mistakes and growth and learning because there are no mistakes to be made , no space for growth , and never anything new to learn , and that is the key component to the entire purpose of the story . \\nnow i\\'m not saying that\\'s necessarily the way it was intended to be interpreted , but that is hands down the proper way in which it should be . \\nbesides a hidden symbolic depth and themes that go beyond what we can absorb from previews , this film has elements of physical wonder and strength that make it just so great to watch . \\nthe visual effects are indeed striking and what little color is revealed is impartially favorable . \\nafter spending the bulk of the movie staring at black and white , it\\'s hard not to identify and appreciate the fact that our own world allows for all that brilliance and more . \\na truly intelligent addition to it all , however , is the charming and ardently attainable cast that operates together like clockwork . \\nthat said , the plot goes as such . \\ndavid and jennifer are two very 90\\'s high school twins with the typical \" relationship \" outline of don\\'t-mess-with-my-life-and-i-won\\'t-mess-with-yours . \\nthey demonstrate the well-known teenage qualities of two of the common versions of adolescents today . \\ndavid is the shyer , subtler twin who would rather watch tv land than mtv , while jennifer is the wild , licentious one who spends her days at the mall and relishes in the pleasures of the offensive world of degradation . \\nbut when a freak accident enchantingly plops them smack dab in the middle of pleasantville as two of the main characters , they are forced to depend on each other to make it back home . \\nnevertheless , jennifer works her magic and introduces the town to a more unrestrained approach to life , and while david frantically tries to stop her and get them back home , he realizes that change was exactly what the town needed . \\nand , as said earlier , not to flip the town around into some corrupt society , but rather to give people the choice to decide between good and bad and to reap the results of their decisions and learn from them . \\nnot only were difficult choices being brought upon the town , but the simple accepted occurrences of ordinary existence also began to take place . \\npeople got hurt . \\nthey cried . \\nthey became afraid and happy and thoughtful and started to think for themselves , and that\\'s when their physical world turned colors as well . \\nthis can be looked upon as quite a controversial movie , but to me the message is finally clear . \\ni hope after reading this people can be more open to the film than they had been in the past , and realize that without choosing how our own lives will be run , we\\'ll never know what we could have done better . \\nuntil the next great movie i see , i remain sincerely , danielle flynn , imr \\n',\n",
       "  b'remember back in the mid 1990s when crime and macabre movies were all the rage ? \\n \" pulp fiction \" and \" fargo \" both managed to get oscar nominations for the best picture , and not surprisingly , a slew of rip-offs followed in the years thereafter . \\nthat fad seems to be over but here comes christopher mcquarrie writing and directing \" the way of the gun \" that at first glance looks like another of those wanna-be\\'s but upon closer inspection doesn\\'t look like anything comprehendable . \\nit\\'s a crime story so wrapped up in its own little world it has a claustrophobic atmosphere - a film that won\\'t allow the story much room to expand outside its handful of characters and somehow still manages to turn a simple premise into something so complex its ridiculous . \\ncomplexity should come as no surprise to anyone who\\'s familiar with mcquarrie , he wrote \" the usual suspects , \" which has become a cult favorite despite little critical acclaim . \\nthat film had a great story and was well directed but had such an elaborate , confusing screenplay it leaves many viewers scratching their heads after repeated viewings . \\nyou have to wonder if mcquarrie really had everything mapped out or if he was going for the hollywood idea that \" if it\\'s really confusing and about criminals and cops that makes it fascinating . \" \\nwith \" the way of the gun \" mcquarrie seems to be capitalizing on the same idea , but this time the story is far less commercial - a shame because maybe that would have helped . \\nthe film tells the story of two drifters with no ambition and barely a reason to live but aren\\'t hell-bent on death either ( played by ryan phillipie and benecio del toro ) . \\nthey get lucky when they hear about a scheme between a big-shot exec guy and his trophy wife who are going to have a baby through in vitro fertilization . \\nthey figure they can kidnap the surrogate mother ( played by juliette lewis ) and get a nice ransom . \\nalong the way we continually learn of the shady dealings between the exec , his wife , their hired goons and the \" bag man \" ( played by james caan - the only actor in the film who looks like he knows what he\\'s doing ) . \\nthe exec is some kind of money launderer so he obviously can\\'t call the authorities for help . \\nhis goons and the bag man are on the kidnappers\\' trail and each make different offers to get the mother back . \\nthe exec\\'s son is a doctor who also gets pulled into the fray and wants to make sure his patient is all right . \\nmeanwhile each of these characters has something hidden up their collective sleeves and the double-crosses , secret love affairs and torrid pasts come as no surprise even though little of it has any relevance at all . \\nmcquarrie doesn\\'t know the meaning of the word simple . \\nhe seems to be more interested in showing us how clever he is than making a good movie . \\neverything has to be complicated and confusing , so much so that it\\'s to the point of surrealism . \\nnothing is what it seems in this reality , it\\'s one of those movies where you get dropped right into the middle of the criminal world and are expected to know most of the industry\\'s rules and regulations . \\nevery scene with caan\\'s character exemplifies this perfectly - the kidnappers already know who he is and even chat with him , getting into conversations about \" the business \" and how it works and we\\'re hardly given a clue as to what they\\'re talking about . \\nthese characters are probably supposed to be great criminal sketches but they\\'re more like ideas ripped-off from sketches found in david mamet\\'s trash . \\nno one here really acts like a real person , and the story is even further removed from reality . \\nit\\'s like a dream without any appeal . \\ntake the opening scene for example ; the phillipe and del toro characters are in a parking lot across the street from a bar or a club counting their money and stuff . \\nthey sit on a brand-new mercedes and the car alarm goes off , the owner is waiting in line and yells at them to get away from his car but they don\\'t move . \\nthe guy and his loud-mouth , potty-mouth girlfriend and about 20 other people cross the street and gang up on them . \\nyou\\'d think phillipe ? and del toro are ? going to pull out guns and scare them away but they don\\'t , instead phillipe throws one punch and the two get beat down by a mob . \\nthere\\'s a lot of things i didn\\'t understand about this scene : first of all the owner of the mercedes isn\\'t some yuppie or old rich snob , he\\'s like a hippie straight out of the 60s . \\nsecondly , the two main characters seem to believe that they can actually take on the mob unarmed . \\nlastly , it serves no purpose in the long run because later in the film the two are packing more artillery than a small country\\'s army . \\nif they were suicidal they wouldn\\'t have gone on the kidnapping job in the first place ( and where they get all those guns is never explained either ) . \\nthere\\'s a lot more i could pick apart about this film but that would be an exercise in futility . \\nwhat it all comes down to is that nothing here is what it seems - which would be great if this movie were about pretty much any other story than what it is . \\nabsolutely none of the characters are likable or believable . \\nand it\\'s all coated with a thin layer of black comedy which is good for a chuckle here and there but this film is definitely not a flat-out black comedy and its use of such seems like a desperate attempt to kill screen time . \\nwith any film you see , whether you like it or not , you can at least understand what the appeal was to it , why someone would want to make it and why someone would want to see it . \\ni can\\'t say either for \" the way of the gun , \" because it has very little going for it and i can\\'t imagine anyone intelligently defending it . \\n',\n",
       "  b'it\\'s an interesting premise . \\nour reality is only real to us because it is what we perceive to be real . \\nin truth , our entire existences are lived out in our minds as we are fed information through electronic inputs directly to our brains . \\nwhat we see , what we do , everything around us is nothing more than a computer-generated construct interlinked with the minds of others through a vastly powerful artificial intelligence . \\nour bodies , severely atrophied , are kept alive for the sole purpose of generating heat and electrical energy for a dominating order of machines which control the planet . \\nthe sci-fi realm has been waiting a little while for something new to come along . \\nthe matrix isn\\'t it - the idea of a war between man and a sentient computer network , a sham world , the ability to plug one\\'s brain into a computer , has all been gleaned from such sources as the terminator , dark city , and a few star trek episodes ( both classic and next generation ) . \\nwhat is new is the ability to weave all of these various elements together and succeed in producing a film that is both entertaining as well as thought-provoking . \\nkeanu reeves plays a computer whiz nicknamed neo , who is plucked out of the artificial world ( known as the matrix ) by a group of renegade humans who are clandestinely fighting to expose the fallacy of the computer-generated existence and free humankind from the oppression of the machines . \\nthe group\\'s leader , morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) , has chosen neo because he believes neo is \" the one \" who is destined to lead the attack against the artificial intelligence . \\n>from the beginning of the film , we are kept on our toes trying to figure things out . \\nthis , in a lesser movie would be annoying , but the matrix presents itself in an intelligent manner which makes the puzzle rather interesting and even fun . \\nwhat is reality ? \\nwhat is a sham ? \\nthe film turns our very perception of life on its side . \\nmore than once , we are also presented with the question of whether we would rather know the harsh truth of reality , or live a life of relative bliss , oblivious to the true nature of our surroundings . \\nas viewers , this is intriguing enough , so imagine what it would be like for neo . \\nand who to better play a bewildered person than keanu reeves ? \\nreeves , whom i\\'ve never really cared for as an actor , is competent in roles which require a lot of straightforwardness , and little subtlety . \\nhe was good in speed , for example , but laughably poor in a walk in the clouds . \\nneo is actually one of those roles which reeves slips into rather nicely , so much of my expectation was happily for naught . \\nin a couple of places , the script even capitalizes upon his wooden nature , and this is a heavy credit to writers/directors andy and larry wachowski . \\ni mean , since bill and ted\\'s excellent adventure , what movie could you say really \" utilized \" keanu reeves ? \\nmore interesting than reeves is fishburne , who\\'s morpheus nearly runs the gamut of emotions , and convincingly so . \\nvery surprising for a sci-fi movie . \\nfishburne also maintains a certain demeanor about himself throughout , as if he always knows what to expect . \\nthis helps to further the aura of his character\\'s proficiency and extensive knowledge . \\nhugo weaving as agent smith , one of the artificial intelligence\\'s anti-intruder programs , is also good playing his deadpan , no-nonsense , kick ass role , which requires him to show emotion at the appropriate time . \\nunfortunately , when weaving speaks for more than a few sentences in a row , the nature of his character\\'s speech pattern becomes a little more laughable than impressive . \\ncarrie-anne moss plays trinity , morpheus\\'s number one assistant who becomes somewhat of a love interest for neo . \\nalthough her character is somewhat inconsistent , moss nevertheless delivers an above par performance when fishburne isn\\'t in the picture . \\nthere were few expenses spared when it comes to the special effects . \\nmany methods of imagery are employed , from modeling to bluescreen to computer graphics . \\nof special note is the use of the \" freeze and turn \" effect where the entire scene is frozen , turned , then continued from a new angle . \\nthis is accomplished by using a large number of still cameras employed in a semi-circle , with motion picture cameras placed at the two ends . \\nthe motion cameras film the action , and at the appropriate moment all the still cameras fire at once . \\nplace each still image in a film sequence and you get a nearly seamless transition from the first motion camera to the second . \\npretty slick . \\nthe matrix drips with style . \\nfrom the clothing to the music to the action , we\\'re watching an exaggerated version of what we\\'re used to . \\nmuch of it seems like the combination of two genres of the hong kong action film - there\\'s a lot of kung fu , there\\'s a lot of gunplay . \\nwhen a character is letting go with an automatic weapon , much is made of the empty cartridges falling to the floor in slow motion . \\nthere\\'s also the element of the japanese action cartoon ( called anime by aficionados ) , especially in the way the sequences are filmed in sweeping pans and emphasized actions through special effects . \\ncombined , it\\'s really like no live-action film i have ever seen . \\nthe film is not without its faults . \\nsome of the scenes and ideas are \" borrowed \" a little too liberally from other films , and one component of the ending is decidedly disappointing . \\nsome of the lines are also pretty bad - in one instance , a supporting character incorrectly delivers a famous saying , and it wasn\\'t meant to be a joke . \\nhowever , these shortcomings detract little from what is an overall solid action sci-fi film that for once does more than merely entertain . \\n',\n",
       "  b\"in our time . \\nin our modern world , where the cool rule , it's hard to imagine that shakespeare is becoming 'the man' . \\nand yet - film after film , after film , is based on his everlasting magic . \\nin warner brothers' latest production , shakespeare is kicking ass to a rap beat , while his magic and intelligence slowly fades away . \\nthough the producers of the matrix have vaguely based their picture on william shakespeare's 'romeo and juliet' , its title sequence with a frightening rap song and a black limo making its way through the dark streets of new york , is very hard to associate with shakespeare's poetry . \\nthe film takes place during a silent war between the two major mafia families in the city - the afro americans against the chinese . \\nthe youngest son of a chinese mafia chieftain is found murdered . \\nthe afro-americans are immediately suspected , but a peace treaty is signed between the two godfathers . \\nit is at this point that han ( the romeo of the story ) finds out about his brother's death . \\nescaping from a prison in china , he returns to united states to avenge his brother's fate . \\nbut before he can restore justice with his kung fu kicks , he falls in love with a mysterious beauty . \\nthe only problem is that she is the daughter of his enemy . . \\nthere's only a weak echo of shakespeare's talent in this disappointing production . \\nand there are more problems besides its title . \\nof course we don't call it a deformation of a great masterpiece . \\nwe call it 'modernization' . \\nit seems that the producers fear that the audience will not respond to lyrics , without any car chases and gun fights . \\nthis lack of respect for the audience i find very disturbing . \\nkenneth brannagh has already proven that shakespeare doesn't need to be updated , because his tales are grounded in the basics of life and human nature . \\nand as long as love , hate , honesty and corruption do exist , everyone will understand and embrace shakespeare . \\ni must admit that i found 'rome must die' very confusing . \\ni can forgive andrzej bartkowiak , since it is his first attempt at directing . \\nhe manages to create an incredible atmosphere and directs with a firm precision . \\nunfortunately he completely forgot about character- and story developments . \\nhis latest picture is therefore visually impressive , but intellectually hollow . \\nthe love story between han ( jet li ) and trish ( aalyah ) , and the mafia intrigues are undeveloped and simplified . \\njet li is one of the most amazing fighters to ever hit the silver screen and aalyah has a magical voice . \\ntheir achievement save this film from being completely braindead , but they are not actors , and therefore can not act . \\nthey are nothing more than two celebrities put together . \\nthe other actors , including isaiah washington , russell wong , henry o and dmx all give the standard mediocre performances . \\ndelroy lindo is the only one that projects a coherent image of reality . \\nbut there's more than acting to worry about . \\neven with li's incredible skills in martial arts , the action scenes ( though technically excellent ) are too long and story updates simply embarrassing . \\nto make a long story short : 'romeo must die' is not intelligent enough to be a thriller , not sensual enough to be a love story and too serious to be a fun action film . \\nit is certain that bartkowiak would be much better off with o this embarrassing and completely unnecessary parallel to 'romeo and juliet' , so the film is completely stuck - not sure of what to be . \\nand in the end it's nothing . \\nthere are no performances worthy of notice , no interesting character- or story surprises . \\nso again , the only good thing about it is its technical achievement . \\nthis film can boast of great sound , fast paced editing , solid cinematography and some very well coordinated action sequences . \\nthe music is another factor that prevents you from leaving the theatre . \\nit is mostly provided by aalyah's enchanting voice and several carefully inserted rap songs by various artists , that create a kind of 'ghetto feel' to it . \\nbut when i think back , it's not much i remember from this 'production' . \\nas in almost every summer movie , there are some interesting scenes , but most of the moments that i remember are associated with massive special effects . \\nit is not a film that will get any attention for its artistic qualities , simply because it doesn't have any . \\nfor someone who has never read shakespeare , it's another popcorn film . \\nfor those of us who has , it's a waste of money , time and brain cells . \\n\",\n",
       "  b'being the self-proclaimed professional film critic that i am , i am somewhat embarrassed to admit that i had not seen lawrence of arabia ( coming soon to dvd ) until only recently . \\nafter all , it\\'s considered by just about everyone to be the masterpiece epic of director david lean , who also directed films such as bridge on the river kwai , and doctor zhivago . \\nso one day , a friend of mine loaned me a copy of the video and i sat down and watched it . \\ni was initially skeptical that something made almost 40 years ago would be able to keep my attention for the butt-numbing 3 1/2 hours of its duration . \\nbut now i fully understand why this has become the film that other epic films are judged against -- the winner of seven academy awards in 1963 for best picture , director , editing , cinematography , art direction , music , and sound . \\nafter watching the film again , i am convinced that it is simply one of the finest works of cinematic genius to ever illuminate the big screen . \\nbased on the autobiographical writing of british officer t . e . \\nlawrence during world war i , lawrence of arabia depicts lawrence ( played by then-unknown actor peter o\\'toole ) as a lieutenant lacking any sort of military discipline whatsoever . \\nbored with his assignment of coloring maps for the british army in a dimly lit headquarters building , lawrence jumps at the opportunity to be re-assigned as an observer for an arabian prince fighting against the turkish army . \\nlawrence quickly sees just how caring and great these desert dwelling people can be and ends up rallying the various tribes together to fight the turks and help the british turn the tide of world war i . \\nshot in panavision\\'s famed super 70mm format , the film beautifully illustrates the definition of the word epic . \\nit is absolutely breathtaking . \\nusing stunning cinematography , costuming , and direction , shot in the most uninhabitable location on the face of the earth , i can only imagine what it must have been like to sit in a theater in 1962 and watch this story unfold before my eyes . \\nevery shot is choreographed as a portrait -- a living tribute to a great land . \\ndavid lean put his reputation on the line to get this film completed , and the fact that it was even greenlit in the first place says something about the ideology of the motion picture industry at the time , a far cry from its pathetic , uncreative existence today . \\nafter watching the film , the first thing that came to my mind was , \" i\\'ve got to do a remake of this film ! \" \\nbut then i thought about trying to pitch the idea to a modern-day movie executive : \" okay , it\\'s going to be almost four hours long and shot over three months on location in the sahara desert . \\nwe are going to need to blow up a full-size train because computer-generated effects probably wont do it justice . \\nand we are not going to use any big stars , and won\\'t have any female actors since there\\'s no love story . \" \\nyes , my friends , the velvet curtain fell on the golden-era of hollywood a long time ago . \\nbut at least we still have the proof to show all would-be producers and directors out there just how good a film can be . \\n',\n",

       "  b'warning : this review contains some spoilers for the 1964 film \" fail-safe . \" \\nif you haven\\'t seen the film yet , proceed with caution . \\nnutshell : a relevant , intelligent , suspenseful drama . \\nstill powerful today , even after the end of the cold war . \\n-------------------- \" fail-safe \" ( usa , 1964 ) drama , 111 minutes \\nscreenplay by walter bernstein based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler produced by max e . youngstein directed by sidney lumet \\nreview by jamahl epsicokhan -------------------- \\nthe most ironic aspect of nuclear war is that it doesn\\'t have a winning side and a losing side . \\nin a nuclear confrontation , everybody loses , and the aftereffects have devastating effects that impact the entire world--assuming the world survives . \\nthe idea--and perhaps the only real option--is to avoid war at all costs . \\nthis is the theme of sidney lumet\\'s \" fail-safe , \" a fictional drama based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler . \\n \" fail-safe \" takes place during the heart of the cold war ( the actual film was released two years after the cuban missile crisis ) , when the united states and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue that can be summarized in a single word : communism . \\nthe premise centers around a combination of accidents and operation flaws . \\nfive u . s . bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered to set a routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america . \\nthe unidentified aircraft turns out to be a commercial airliner , but a mechanical failure strikes the military base that commands the bombers . \\nsuddenly out of contact , and with standing orders to remain on course until receiving new directives , the bomber pilots cannot be recalled , and they proceed to moscow with the intention of destroying it with a nuclear strike . \\na great deal of \" fail-safe \" \\'s plot follows various characters as they attempt to devise ways of stopping the u . s . bombers from reaching russia\\'s borders--at any cost . \\nthe plot is compelling , and the story creates urgency and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios . \\nthe reality sets in quickly as one attempt to turn the bombers after another fails . \\ngeneral bogan ( frank overton ) , taking orders directly from the president of the united states himself ( henry fonda ) , is powerless--the fate of the world lies in the hands of an automated , pre-programmed system that may not be stoppable , simply because the creators of the war machines were too efficient in their task to make a no-win situation winnable . \\nthe events in \" fail-safe \" are fascinating because they\\'re anything but predictable , but the real reason \" fail-safe \" works is because it understands more about nuclear war than what exists within the confines of its plot . \\na key ingredient to the film is its ability to create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war , communism , the cold war , and the united states\\' role in all of it . \\nmost of this is through the film\\'s use of the character groeteschele ( walter matthau ) , an arrogant civilian theorist of nuclear weapons use who , incidentally , is on the president\\'s advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging a nuclear war . \\nmany of the film\\'s most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one of the key voices . \\nearly in the film , he hosts a dinner party where he explains the importance of \" strategy \" in a nuclear assault to \" minimize \" casualties . \\n \" what\\'s the difference between 60 million and 100 million dead ? \" \\na guest asks impatiently . \\n \" forty million , \" groeteschele responds wryly . \\nthe problem with groeteschele\\'s mindset is that he * believes * nuclear combat to be a viable method of war . \\nthe only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals . \\ngroeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over . \\nyet his answer to the arms race is not to slow down and try to cool the situation off , as general black ( dan o\\'herlihy ) has often recommended . \\non the contrary--according to groeteschele , that would lead to russia having * more * nuclear weapons than the u . s . , which would clearly put america at a disadvantage . \\nsuch a stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arms race . \\n \" fail-safe \" clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war , and , likewise , it becomes a central theme in the film . \\nwhy continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times over ? \\nis it wise ? \\nis it even logical ? \\nno , not really . \\nalthough \" fail-safe \" is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism , there is a scene in the film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial , one-sided sort of way . \\nagain , this is achieved through groeteschele , who is easily the film\\'s most important character in terms of the larger-theme significance . \\nin addition to providing the central \" pro-nuclear war \" voice that the film warns against , he also makes key remarks about communists that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone to when it came to communism . \\nthe context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib . \\none of groeteschele\\'s \" logical \" trains of thought ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that it\\'s merely absurd . \\nhe labels the average marxist an \" unfeeling , calculating machine \" that will do whatever it takes to preserve itself . \\ngroeteschele takes it so far as to say that if the u . s . drops the warhead on moscow , the soviets will * instantly * surrender , for to retaliate would invite counter-measures that would further destroy russia\\'s home soil--which must be preserved at all costs . \\ngroeteschele seems to forget these people are human beings with emotions ; general black quickly reminds him that the soviets would attack out of revenge--as any normal person would . \\nthe irony here is groeteschele\\'s own mechanical theorizing . \\nhe is so quick to judge the enemy that he doesn\\'t even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns . \\nonce the film makes it evident that turning the u . s . bombers will be impossible , the question becomes what the * consequences * of destroying moscow will be . \\njust how will the soviet union\\'s leader react , and what can the president do to convey his best intentions ? \\n ( just * how * does one pass off the deaths of millions of people as an * mishap * ? ) \\nwith the help of his translator buck ( larry hagman ) , the president negotiates at length with the soviet leader , in scenes that prove amazingly taut and powerful in their simplicity , with lumet\\'s long takes of fonda and hagman in the same frame , exchanging the dialog between the president and the soviet leader . \\nwithout getting into too much detail , i will say that the compromise they ultimately reach is very costly , yet necessary and as sensible as possible under the circumstances . \\n ( that is , as sensible as a nuclear \" incident \" can probably be . ) \\nit does accomplish what it must : it avoids an all-out war , something that simply isn\\'t possible because of its all-too-real consequences . \\ndramatically , the ending is quite powerful , and the use of o\\'herlihy\\'s character as the symbolic \" matador \" ( providing a bookend to the film by ending the story while tying into his dream sequence from the film\\'s opening ) , is particularly appropriate . \\n \" fail-safe \" is a production of a major hollywood studio ( released by columbia pictures ) , and it has the structure of a high-tension suspense thriller that one might expect from a hollywood film . \\nnevertheless , under lumet\\'s direction and walter bernstein\\'s intelligent adaptation of burdick\\'s and wheeler\\'s novel , the film continues to have a lasting effect even after the events on screen have unfolded . \\nthe film often warns that the automation of war is something that may make nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence of such mass arming . \\nbut it was the conscious , human choice to * initialize * this automatic arming that \" fail-safe \" also finds dangerous . \\nin retrospect , the arms race seems to be one of the most puzzling exercises in futility of the century . \\nit\\'s just fortunate that both sides were finally able to come to their senses and slow down , rather than continuing groeteschele\\'s dangerous approach of speeding up and causing a possible meltdown . \\n',\n",

       "  b'it\\'s been a good long while since we had a good old fashioned thriller , where mostly everything goes right for the audience and wrong for the characters , but it\\'s been even longer since i saw a thriller that actually * shock * cared for the characters , not merely judged them but actually allowed their human foibles , flaws , and strengths to emerge so radiantly . \\ni\\'d saw that it\\'s been at least a couple decades , even as far back to the great hitchcock thrillers , though i\\'m hardly comparing \" a simple plan \" to , say , \" rear window \" or \" strangers on a train . \" \\nyet it\\'s almost as good . \\nit\\'s simple , yet strangely complex , and astonishingly rewarding , because instead of moving from plot point to plot point , and merely laying out they-might-be-caught overtones , it instead concerns itself with the moral corruption and depths of greed that its protagonists can go to , all without ever judging them as either evil or even immoral . \\nelegantly directed by sam raimi ( yes , the same ) , \" a simple plan \" concerns itself with the discovery of a crashed plane and within a bag full of millions of dollars by an upright , moderately financially stable working man ( bill paxton ) , his dim-witted brother ( billy bob thornton ) , and his drinking buddy ( brent briscoe ) . \\nwithout anyone around , and the possibility that no one would come looking for it , the three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes , they will keep it , but until any authorities or possible owners of the cash come looking , and so they generally don\\'t flaunt anything they don\\'t want to flaunt , they\\'ll keep it stored away in the custody of paxton . \\nthe possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse : a ) they could endlessly play cat and mouse with the authorities ; b ) they could try to fight off the rightful owners , who are either villainous or just ; or c ) they could fight amongst themselves . \\n \" a simple plan , \" though borrows a little from each of these . \\na little tiff with the cops here , a subplot involving an alleged fbi agent ( a chilling gary cole ) there ) , and a bit of inside feuding over here . \\nbut , as austin powers would say , that\\'s not necessarily its bag ( baby ) . \\nwhat i most admired about this film , and what makes this a far superior and unique thriller is that it\\'s successfully able to have its cake and eat it too . \\nit effectively involves some of the traditional thriller cliches , like the ones mentioned above , but at the same time , it involves itself more deeply with the way the characters become morally corrupt and what price they have to pay to have what they think is happiness in a black duffle bag . \\nso while steps are taken to neatly cover things up , and these subsequent steps go miserably awry , the film choses to never loose the sight that in covering things up to the extent that these characters have to , they are slowly losing their souls and their humanity . \\nin one early scene , paxton and thornton have to make a trip back to the plane to return some of the money so it doesn\\'t look like it was all stolen ( not a bad idea ) , when thornton screws up ( as he does continuously throughout the movie ) , and paxton has to do some major covering-up ( read : homicide ) . \\ninstead of a quick murder and immeadiate hands-washing , raimi shows a lengthy , painful shot from a low-angle onto paxton\\'s face as he tries to sift through his emotions and reach a conclusion . \\nthere\\'s a similar shot afterwards of paxton watching the murder he\\'s committing and taking in all the horror which is also wonderfully effective , but the previous shot is even better : more morally complex and more gut-wrenching . \\nin short , probably the best piece of direction raimi\\'s ever done , demonstrating once again that sometimes the simplest way to do something yields the best results ( for further proof , watch \" persona \" \\'s \" sex scene \" and witness what may be the best scene ingmar bergman\\'s ever done ) . \\nbut the film hardly stops here ; it follows completely through and rarely loses sight of its characters humanity and the depletion thereof . \\nyet it also moves from step to step in such a graceful method that we never feel like the film is merely stamping out the plot points of the story . \\nwhen the time comes for paxton to start becoming selfish and thus diabolical ( with aid from his pregnant wife , played by bridget fonda , a pal to raimi ) , he does , and soon the horror of the situation is escalating to tragic heights . \\nthere\\'s at least two grand shootouts , and at least one of them may be one of the greatest shootouts in cinema history , and when they arrive , they don\\'t come with masochistic delight but with cringe-inducing horror . \\nduring the one , i was actually sinking into my chair , with the mantra \" they can\\'t do this , can they ? \" \\nstreeming through my head . \\nin fact , this film , which is getting many comparisons to the coen\\'s [superior , but forget about it] \" fargo , \" has many similar moments of manic insanity , attributed to the major amount of subtlety and restraint with which the directors direct what , in other hands , would be over-the-top distractedness ( imagine , i suppose , robert rodriguez directing this . . . then \\nagain , after seeing the \" evil dead \" films , i\\'d hardly assume raimi would be able to pull something like this off , although there are moments of the film which are easily dubbed \" raimi \" moments , a rifle-shot notwithstanding ) . \\ninstead , raimi directs with maturity and a gentle touch , easily letting the story and characters co-exist , while still letting some of the more traditional raimi elements come out , like some offbeat comic touches . \\nmost particularly , billy bob thornton\\'s character , jacob , is a brilliant creation . \\nhis dim-wittedness is often hilarious ( for most of the film , every line he uttered was greeted with howling laughter ) , but there\\'s authenticity to the performance that strangely enough makes sure that we\\'re not totally laughing at him . \\nthe chuckles he gets are not necessarily ones of full-condescension because thornton is so damn real . \\njacob\\'s a multi-dimensional character , and while being stupid , we see that as not so much a flaw , but a strength to his character : his simplicity is endearing and many of the acts he commits are out of a strong inner strength and belief system , primarily towards the middle where his bud and co-conspirator begins to make some heavy waves concerning the money . \\nthe final third of the film spends much time with him , and many of the touches upon his character , not only by thornton but also by screenwriter scott b . smith ( adapting his own book , by the way ) are just great . \\ni particularly admired a back story about an old high school girlfriend , told by thornton with such sincerity and acception that the cruel story is reversed to near-sweetness and further strength of his saddened character . \\nthornton is absolutely brilliant in this performance , by far the best performance he\\'s ever given and further proof that he\\'s the best character actor in contemporary cinema ( if you don\\'t believe me , go back and watch his wonderful performance in \" primary colors , \" a performance that would have been nominated for an oscar if this hadn\\'t been in the same year ) because he\\'s easily able to slip into a character , and make him completely and utterly believable . \\nhe brings so much weight to the film that , as it is with most character actors , it\\'s difficult picturing anyone else in the role . \\nthe rest of the cast is great too , from paxton\\'s declining working man to chelcie ross\\' amiable town sheriff . \\neven fonda shows off her talents nicely . \\nand if i had any complaints about the film , it\\'s that the plot is almost too simplistic , and that at times , it seems too much like an exercise , like a cruel test on humanity that still pays attention to the humanity involved . \\nand the occasional narration is , as it usually is , annoying ( narration should be used with extreme caution , especially when you\\'re trying to set things up and/or express emotions - didn\\'t raimi watch the first murder scene ? ) . \\nand , the thing that can most usually go wrong with a movie , the ending is basically amiss . \\ni won\\'t reveal it , but it\\'s way too cruel and too much of an outsider set-up , as if the appearance of a plane wasn\\'t already too much of that anyway . \\nfor a film that deals so much and so intimately with the humanity of the characters involved , this is the wrong ending . \\nimagine a character-controlled ending ; otherwise , it\\'s like if in \" crime and punishment \" if the police had caught him instead of him breaking down and confessing . . . not that i\\'m at all comparing \" a simple plan \" to dostoevsky . \\nthe ending does work , despite my protestations , but to me , there was something incessantly nagging and unsatisfying about it ; but if you had no qualms and were happy as a clam with it , then just ignore me and go about your day . \\nbut despite my mere claims , make no mistake that i was completely and utterly edge of my seat throughout , and even sometimes curdling up by the situations that occured , not because of any kind of gore factor ( which is , thankfully for this , very minimal ) , but because the film places its characters in situations and gives them such painful things to overcome that i\\'ve frankly not seen much like it in quite awhile . \\nat least not since the previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece . \\n',\n",

       "  b\"the plot of big momma's house is martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress . \\nthat's not just the high-concept premise ; it's the fully-realized , all-encompassing plot . \\nsuch an emphasis is not unheard-of in the world of hollywood summer entertainment . \\none need merely look back to last summer , when the plot of big daddy was adam sandler being an incompetent surrogate parent . \\nthe trap inherent in such an approach is that the high-concept plot idea better be pretty well-realized , or rest on the shoulders of an extremely talented performer , because you can bet there will be nothing else worth a second of your time -- not a developed character , not a provocative theme , not a witty twist . \\nyou will get 90-plus minutes of martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress -- nothing more , nothing less . \\nthose who find martin lawrence more than an occasionally amusing screen presence may have a shot at enjoying the one-note dud that is big momma's house . \\nothers will simply stare , mouth agape , at its sheer unapologetic laziness . \\nlawrence plays fbi agent malcolm turner , an undercover expert on a stakeout assignment with his partner john ( paul giamatti ) . \\ndangerous convicted bank robber and murderer lester vesco ( terrence howard ) has escaped from prison , and the feds think he's headed for his former girlfriend and presumed-but-never-proved accomplice sherry ( nia long ) . \\nsherry , however , has fled with her son trent ( jascha washington ) , possibly to visit her grandmother hattie mae ( ella mitchell ) , better known as big momma . \\nindeed , sherry appears to be on her way , but big momma is headed out of town without knowing sherry is coming . \\nthat leaves master of disguise malcolm to go under very heavy cover as big momma and find out what sherry knows . \\nbig momma's house's bloodlines are certainly traceable to mrs . \\ndoubtfire -- director raja gosnell edited that film , and the makeup effects were similarly created by greg cannom -- but there's just as strong a whiff of tootsie in the main character's attempt to use his alternate identity to get closer to a woman . \\nunfortunately , big momma's house makes a ridiculous decision neither of those other films made : instead of having the protagonist pose as a completely manufactured character unfamiliar to anyone elses , it places malcolm in the position of playing a friend and family member to several other characters . \\nsuspension of disbelief in big momma's house requires you to believe every other person in the film is blind and/or stupid , since no one notices that one big momma looks or sounds absolutely nothing like the other . \\nof course , laughs trumps logic every time , and big momma's house probably still would have worked in spite of its utter disdain for common sense if it had just managed to be funny . \\nand it misses its best possible opportunity for some great farce by ignoring the simple fact that the real big momma is set up as a foul-tempered beast , while malcolm has to be nurturing in order to get the information he wants out of sherry . \\nunfortunately , no one involved appears to have the faintest idea how to deal with the comic gold mine involved in one real person pretending to be another , very different real person , so they fall back on an endless parade of sight gags : malcolm reacting violently to big momma's explosive diarrhea attack ; malcolm-as-momma schooling a pair of cocky teens in basketball ; malcolm trying to avoid detection as various prostheses give way at inopportune moments ; malcolm delivering a baby because big momma is the town midwife ( one of the few sequences that works ) . \\nmartin lawrence can be likeable enough at times , but there's no reason to care a whit about his budding romance with sherry because malcolm is never an independently significant character . \\nhe's just big momma without the makeup on . \\ni won't waste time commenting on how ineptly the set-up of the escaped convict is employed , since it was clearly a waste of time to the film-makers . \\nthere are a few token scenes of lester looming as a threatening figure , but he's ultimately a distraction in a film that's really about its central visual incongruity ( and the accompanying lascivious glances at nia long's posterior ) . \\ni'm never prepared to underestimate how appealing that idea may be to other people -- several million of them apparently found adam sandler as an incompetent surrogate parent appealing -- but i know that when a film-maker tries to throw a concept at me and pretend that it's an entire film , i duck out of the way . \\nthe gross implausibility of big momma's house might have been tolerable if it was seasoned with more big , cleverly-constructed laughs . \\nits lack of big laughs might have been tolerable if its characters were at all relevant . \\nbig momma's house is ridiculous _and_ not funny . \\nit's just a sad exercise in the jaded presumption that any scene should be considered wacky and hilarious if it involves martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress . \\n\",\n",
       "  b' \" rebel without a cause \" is such an important film in american history because it is a true analysis of youth in america that everyone of all ages can relate to . \\neveryone feels that they are different in some way , that they don\\'t belong in some places and \" rebel without a cause \" successfully shows on screen these universal emotions . \\nno matter what generation you belong to , these feelings are present . \\nthis is why james dean is admired by america , because in this film he represents us all and his actions are actions that we would also execute . \\nin our minds , we just try to do the right thing just like dean\\'s jim stark does . \\nnot only does \" rebel without a cause \" display these universal emotions for all to relate to but it also shows that america has suffered a uniqe pattern in its social structure . \\neach generation looks at its past generation without a strong connection . \\nthis is because times change and in response people change . \\nno matter how popular you were once , as your generation grows older , newer breeds look at you in a different light . \\nthis is why stark and his friends never could form a strong relationship with their parents . \\neven if their parents insisted that they were also rebellious and troublesome in the past , the teens could not believe this . \\nin one humorous scene , stark , his girlfriend judy ( natalie wood ) , and his pal plato ( sal mineo ) pretend they are adults . \\nthey use upper class british accents and in their conversations they make it out to appear that kids are no good and should be ignored . \\nthis scene shows that what was once cool in a past generation is the complete opposite in another . \\nspeaking on behalf of my generation , i feel that dean has lost a lot of his coolness from our perspective as the years have grown by . \\nthe only ones who seem to still lionize him are those members of his generation . same \\ngoes for brando , redford , even deniro . \\ni can only imagine how vaguely matt damon , ben affleck , and brad pitt will be viewed at the mid point of the twenty first century . \\nwill dean even be remembered when these newcomers are forgotten ? \\nany film that sparks this kind of thought is certainly a milestone in american film . \\neven if \" rebel without a cause \" has some ridiculous scenes ( the game of chicken - did people really act this way ? ) , an unbelievable conclusion ( how did everyone end up at the abandoned mansion at the end ? ) , and a silly romance ( wood declares her love for dean after talking to him for a couple hours ) it still is a fabulous film . \\nthe acting is so believable that it is no wonder that dean was considered the epitome of cool . \\nnow , however , the coolness is fading . . . \\n',\n",
       "  b\"jonathan demme's _beloved_ , based on the book toni morrison , is a study in skillful literary adaptation . \\non the one hand , the film manages to recreate key moments from the novel , evoking morrison's pragmatic narrative style without using her authorial voice . \\non the other hand , beloved omits the some of the finer details of the book , favoring an ambiguously defined back story upon which to build the story's main events . \\nthis choice is a smartly made one , for it creates an open space in which the story's wide range of emotions can gestate and grow . \\nindeed , the impact of the film is so protracted that much of it cannot be felt until long after the end credits have rolled . \\n_beloved_ takes place in the second half of the 19th century , during the so-called reconstruction era after the civil war . \\nfor newly-freed slaves , it is a time of confusion and turmoil . \\noprah winfrey is sethe , a slave who escaped a kentucky plantation and took her children to an ohio farmhouse , where she hoped the terror would end . \\nwhat she did not know was that it would follow her there , and remain with her long after the physical threat had vanished . \\n_beloved_ ultimately tells the story of sethe's search for forgiveness , one long-hampered by an unforgettable sin . \\nthe film starts off on a dreary day ten years after sethe's escape , as a violent , unseen energy rocks her dilapidated farmhouse . \\ninvisible hands terrorize her family , flinging objects across rooms , shaking tables , rattling floorboards . \\nsethe's sons run away , perhaps for good , leaving sethe and her daughter denver to fend for themselves . \\ndemme's matter-of-fact handling of this supernatural element is just one of _beloved_'s intriguing aspects . \\nall of the characters take for granted that ghosts are real . \\nwhen paul d ( danny glover ) -- a former slave who escaped kentucky along with sethe -- arrives at the house eight years later and is confronted with the ghost's hellish visions , he doesn't run in terror . \\ninstead , he asks who the ghost is . \\nas in morrison's novel , demme quickly establishes that the horror of the story will not come from the fact of the ghost itself , but from the terrifying past in which the ghost was created . \\nsethe is the one being haunted , but the ghost in the house is the least of her fears . \\nin fact , the ghost is one of the reasons she chooses to stay . \\nthe story takes an bizarre turn with the appearance of beloved ( thandie newton ) , a young black-clad woman who appears on sethe's front lawn , leaned christ-like against a tree stump . \\nsethe and denver immediately take to the rasping woman and try to nurse her to health . \\nthey know not who she is , but that doesn't matter . \\nonly paul d is suspicious of the stranger . \\nlittle does the family know that beloved will bring about many changes , and force sethe to release a guilt she has held onto so urgently for eighteen years . \\nwinfrey is arguably beloved's greatest asset . \\nshe inhabits the role of sethe so convincingly it is hard to believe this is the same woman who shines brightly on a tv talk show . \\nlisa gay hamilton does an impressive job in the emotionally demanding role as the younger sethe , whose appalling actions make her the disturbed woman we see eighteen years later . \\ndanny glover is affable as the sympathetic paul d , as is kimberly elise as denver , sethe's wanderlusting daughter . \\nas sethe's sage-like mother-in-law old baby suggs , beah richards authoritatively commands every scene in which she appears . \\nthe film's least palatable choice of casting is unfortunately that of the role of beloved herself . \\nthandie newton plays the glassy-eyed girl with a demented fervor which is endearing at first , but which becomes off-putting and unintentionally laughable by the end . \\ndeparting from the honed aesthetic he used in such films as _the silence of the lambs_ and _melvin & howard_ , director demme has used a bit of dramatic overstatement to get across the vivid descriptions in morrison's novel . \\ntotemic camera shots and color-saturated scenery are decidedly uncommon in demme's films , but the few he uses here work to the film's benefit . \\n_beloved_'s most memorable scenes are those of baby suggs' gatherings in a forest clearing , where the bright yellow-greens of nature entrance the viewer as much as suggs' words do . \\nfor the most part , though , demme maintains his trademark directorial neutrality . \\nthis , combined with morrison's equally frugal method of storytelling , may make _beloved_ somewhat of a challenge to watch , even to those familiar with the book . \\nthough the film compliments the book extraordinarily well , it falls short in allowing the sort of accessibility one usually expects from a film . \\nnothing is spoon-fed to the viewer . \\nmorrison's novel is just as enigmatic , but unlike a movie , a book can be put down to allow the various undercurrents and themes to churn and absorb . \\nthe movie begins like _poltergeist_ , and ends like _the color purple_ , with shades of _the scarlet letter_ and _little women_ somewhere in the middle . \\ntaken as a whole , beloved is a disquieting , one-of-a-kind experience , one to be viewed with guards down and spirits in abeyance . \\n\",\n",

       "  b\"getting it right is a far far cry from the teenage sex comedy you might expect from a summer movie about male virginity . \\nthe film was directed by randal kleiser , who brought us such bubble-gum classics as grease and the blue lagoon . \\nbut thanks to kleiser's surprisingly good direction and an intelligent script , getting it right is a pleasantly quiet , moving , and memorable film--one geared strictly toward a sophisticated , adult audience . \\ngetting it right stars jesse birdsall ( emily lloyd's boyfriend in wish you were here ) as gavin , a painfully shy 31-year-old hairdresser who lives at home with his parents and who--gasp--is still a virgin . \\ngavin has no problem whatsoever making small talk with the elderly women who clamor for his services at the hair salon , but expose him to a single 30-year-old beauty and he's a mess . \\nmuch to gavin's surprise , the woman who finally brings him out of his shell and robs him of his virginity is joan ( lynn redgrave ) , a rich , married , and lonely 45-year-old . \\ngetting it right is the simple story of gavin's awkward and haphazard efforts to get it right ; that is , to find the right woman to fulfill his life . \\ngetting it right is one of those rare movies that devotes itself entirely to in-depth character development . \\ngavin's self-conscious voice-over narration of his experiences firmly thrusts us into his psyche . \\nwe observe his fascinating metamorphosis from shy and passive introversion to assertive and self-confident maturity . \\nbirdsall's superb , understated performance as gavin is the real backbone of the film ; he seems convincing and authentic throughout . \\nthe charm of getting it right also lies in the wide array of people who inhabit or invade gavin's life . \\ndespite her limited screen time , redgrave makes quite a splash in the movie as gavin's middle-aged seducer . \\nfor a supporting character , joan is unusually and impressively complex , thanks in large part to redgrave's magnificent performance . \\ngavin is also pursued , or perhaps plagued , by minnie , the totally neurotic daughter of a rich aristocrat . \\nafter minnie and gavin meet at a party , she takes great pleasure in disrupting his safe and simple life . \\nhelena bonham carter is delightfully pathetic and kooky in the role , and sir john gielgud , with his tongue in his cheek , embodies the height of arrogance as her father . \\ngavin's eventual love-interest is jenny , the adorable twenty-year-old single mother who assists him at the beauty salon ; london stage actress jane horrocks' fine performance yields a touchingly sweet character . \\npeter cook , the great british satirist , appears briefly in the film as gavin's uptight employer . \\nthe scenes of gavin's home life with his parents are also a treat . \\ngavin's over-protective mother ( pat heywood ) , whom even woody allen would find overbearing , almost steals the movie . \\nher life seems limited to just two activities : treating gavin like a 10-year-old and preparing exotic but inedible meals , such as scalding hot curry and baked chicken with chocolate sauce . \\ngavin and his father's attempts to avoid eating her meals are extremely amusing . \\ngetting it right , for the most part , is very well-crafted , except for two minor shortcomings . \\nfirst , the movie is about 15 minutes too long , and consequently it loses momentum at times . \\nsecond , the film includes an altogether extraneous subplot about the domestic problems between gavin's best friend , harry , and his unfaithful lover , winthrop . \\noverall , however , getting it right is quite memorable for its humor , depth , sophistication , and outstanding acting . \\ndirector kleiser and screenwriter elizabeth jane howard ( adapting her own highly acclaimed novel ) deserve praise for finding just the right tone for this tale of growth , maturation , and self-discovery . \\n\",\n",

       "  b'godzilla is the ultimate culmination of the \" who cares about plot \" summer movie . \\na loose remake of the 1954 \" classic \" japanese monster movie , godzilla , king of the monsters ( which is itself pretty thin in the story department ) , roland emmerich and dean devlin\\'s big-budget lizard-stomps-manhattan disaster flick has been written with the brain dead in mind . \\nthe script isn\\'t just \" dumbed down , \" it\\'s lobotomized . \\ngodzilla lives and dies on special effects alone . \\npresumably , the primary target group for this film is teenage boys , the demographic most likely to shell out $7 repeatedly to see the same images of monster-instigated carnage . \\nthat\\'s not to say that females and other age groups are immune to the special effects seduction ; they\\'re just not as readily susceptible . \\nthis is the third straight movie in a row where emmerich and devlin have demonstrated that a mastery of computer-generated visuals is far more important for making money than the ability to write and direct for actors . \\nstargate was a financial success . \\nindependence day was a runaway hit . \\nand , with godzilla already drowning in hype and merchandising tie-ins before it even opens , it\\'s virtually guaranteed at least $100 million . \\nnice numbers for a film that could have been penned by a not-too-precocious grade school kid . \\ngodzilla isn\\'t completely without merit , although it is close . \\nthere\\'s a certain visceral thrill inherent in watching the giant lizard rip his way through manhattan , but it wears off quickly . \\nfrankly , while the special effects are competent , they\\'re not all that stunning . \\nthere\\'s nothing new here ; it\\'s jurassic park meets aliens , with a little independence day thrown in for bad measure . \\nmaybe it will require george lucas and his new star wars movie to take computer-generated visuals to the next level . \\ngodzilla never really pushes the envelope , preferring to remain within a comfort zone . \\nthe imagination of monster movies like king kong has been replaced by a crass , formulaic approach which disallows creativity . \\n ( how disturbing is it to know that godzilla has been chosen to close the 51st cannes film festival ? ) \\nworst of all , godzilla isn\\'t even exciting . \\nwith the possible exception of a mildly enjoyable car chase near the end , there isn\\'t a sequence in this film that raises the pulse . \\neven the scenes with dozens of aircraft attacking the monster are so devoid of tension and suspense that they are yawn-provoking . \\nindependence day may have been dumb , but it was full of \" adrenaline moments \" capable of getting the audience involved in the action . \\nin this aspect of its production , as in so many others , godzilla is lacking . \\nactually , part of the problem is that we\\'re never sure who we\\'re supposed to be rooting for : the green monster with an attitude or the paper-thin humans trying to stop him . \\nthe plot , such as it is , can be summed up rather simply . \\nafter sinking a few ships and leaving some footprints on tropical islands , godzilla shows up in the big apple . \\nhe does some of the usual tourist things : stops by madison square garden , visits the chrysler building , goes on a walk through central park , and takes the subway . \\nin the process , he knocks over a few buildings and steps on countless cabs , but he never has trouble with traffic jams . \\non hand to stop him is an elite u . s . army unit , led by a slightly less-arrogant-than-usual military man ( kevin dunn ) and a biologist named nick tatopoulos , who has a theory about godzilla . \\nin his opinion , the big guy is actually a lizard grown to enormous proportions as a result of the radiation given off by french atomic bomb tests in the south pacific . \\nin nick\\'s words , godzilla is \" a mutated aberration ? an incipient creature ? the first of its kind . \" \\nas luck would have it , nick\\'s old girlfriend , audrey ( maria pitillo ) , is a reporter based at a new york tv station . \\nalong with her cameraman friend , animal ( hank azaria ) , she decides to follow nick around as he trails godzilla . \\nthen , just when the military has rejected nick\\'s theory about why godzilla is in new york , a member of the french secret service ( jean reno ) recruits him for a special assignment . \\ninstead of stomping around tokyo this time , godzilla has chosen new york city . \\nunfortunately , manhattan has been destroyed so many times in recent disaster movies ( independence day , deep impact , armageddon ) that it\\'s becoming boring . \\nthe whole tradition of monsters roaming around the city started with king kong , but the big ape was only about 30 feet tall . \\nhe could climb the empire state building . \\nat ten times that height , godzilla would be more likely to knock it over . \\ngodzilla contains a few lame attempts at humor . \\nthere\\'s an ongoing feud between animal and his wife that plays like sit-com material , an unfunny and repetitive gag about how no one can pronounce nick\\'s last name properly , and a rather tame attack on film critics roger ebert and gene siskel . \\nboth of the popular personalities have alter egos in the film : \" ebert , \" the mayor of new york , is played by michael lerner , and \" gene \" ( lorry goldman ) is his campaign manager . \\nebert\\'s re-election slogan is , not surprisingly , \" thumbs up for new york . \" \\nthe siskel/ebert stuff is amusing the first time it\\'s used , but , after a while , it grows tiresome . \\nand , although the \" characters \" don\\'t serve any real purpose , they keep popping up . \\ngodzilla is saddled with an unimpressive cast . \\nthis is largely because emmerich doesn\\'t want to risk a human performance upstaging his lizard . \\nthat\\'s not to say that matthew broderick and jean reno aren\\'t capable of good performances ( both have done their share of solid acting in the past ) , but they aren\\'t a-list names . \\nthen again , considering the quality of the writing , even pacino and deniro would have been hard- pressed to shine . \\nmaria pitillo ( dear god ) plays the love interest and hank azaria ( great expectations ) is on hand to present what is supposed to be comic relief . \\nultimately , it doesn\\'t really matter what i ( or any other critic , for that matter ) have to say about the movie . \\ntristar has assumed that godzilla , like all self-proclaimed summer event motion pictures , is pretty much critic-proof . \\nit may also be word-of-mouth-proof . \\nthose who want to see the movie will see it no matter what i write or their friends say . \\nso , when i go on record to assert that godzilla is one of the most idiotic blockbuster movies of all time , it\\'s like spitting into the wind . \\nemmerich and devlin are master illusionists , waving their wands and mesmerizing audiences with their smoke and mirrors . \\nit\\'s probably too much to hope that some day , movie-goers will wake up and realize that they\\'ve been had . \\n',\n",

       "  b'capsule : where are you tonight , leni rienfenstal ? \\nstarship troopers is an expensive , hateful and unenjoyable piece of violent pornography -- and bad pornography , at that . \\nit is not good cinema , not good storytelling , and not even stupid fun : it\\'s so cynically , calculatedly bone-headed that even the least demanding members of the audience i was with were alternately bored and revulsed . \\nit\\'s one of the worst movies i\\'ve seen in a long time . \\nwhy am i calling this movie pornography ? \\npornography , in the abstract , is anything which is calculated to appeal to the baser instincts . \\ni remember reading a review of full metal jacket which described the climact moment at the end of the movie , where private joker has to shoot the downed vc sniper , as \" a near-pornographic eternity \" . \\ni didn\\'t agree with that assessment , but i could see what was being implied : the reviewer felt as if the audience was being incited to stand up and pump their fists and shout \" do \\'er , man , do \\'er ! \" \\nthat sentiment is echoed ad nauseam throughout starship troopers . \\nit\\'s * literally * like a giant recruitment film that has gone berserk . \\nit tries frantically to enlist our emotions but it winds up only being dull or sickening . \\nthe film takes place in our future , when earth has come under attack by some alien species that doesn\\'t appear to have intelligence . \\nto counterattack , humankind does the single stupidest thing imaginable : instead of nuke the planet from orbit , which they\\'re clearly capable of , they send down grunts with m-16 rifles . \\nthis isn\\'t heinlein , it\\'s a bad wwii movie , one where all the most obvious points of satire are ever poked and prodded in combat scenes that are noisy , repetitive , and ultimately tiresome . \\n ( one scene has a journalist on a battlefield , filimg soldiers being slaughtered , and ends with groaning predictability : said cameraman gets skewered , too . ) \\nthe soldiers and their commanders are consistently idiotic . \\nthey do not possess a germ of tactical intelligence or even common sense . \\nthey don\\'t even behave like soldiers in a bad * movie * , and therefore we don\\'t care about them . \\nwe hated the tom berenger character in platoon , but he * mattered * , and therefore we were curious to learn about his fate . \\nhere , we don\\'t even hate the bugs -- what\\'s there to hate ? \\nhating them would be like cursing a hurricaine . \\nif there\\'s anything really hateful there , the movie doesn\\'t know how to give it to us . \\nthe screenwriter ( ed neumeier -- perhaps a better appelation would be \" screen typist \" ) and director ( the increasingly talent-impaired paul verhoeven ) have not found any way to make the characters or the story serve each other . \\none of the subplots concerns a woman pilot who\\'s great at getting out of tight situations , and does it again and again and again . \\nonce or twice is fine . \\nby the fifth or sixth time , it\\'s worn out its welcome . \\nthere\\'s never any sense that these people are really thinking their way out of anything , or really being tested to show their mettle . \\nalso , the movie is irritatingly selective with how effective the bugs are to earthling weaponry . \\nif a bug has one of the humans screaming in its grasp , then five guys can stand around it and blast away on full auto without doing a damned thing . \\nbut if one human gets cornered , he lays waste to whole platoons of bugs with one clip . \\nuh-huh . \\nthe very worst feature of the movie is its repulsive quasi-fascist flavor . \\ni say \" quasi- \" because while the movie uses many of the trappings of fascism ot eroticize its action -- the gear , the uniforms , etc . -- the movie doesn\\'t have the nerve ( or the brains ) to be genuinely fascist , or intelligent about the subject . \\nthe bumpers between scenes , which are apparently intended to parody wartime recruitment propaganda are propaganda -- just so clumsy and oafish that they wind up making the bugs look relatively innocuous in comparison . \\nlike the rest of the movie . \\nthere\\'s more , i suppose , but it\\'s not worth it . \\nthe acting is bland , neither arsenic nor gravy ; the music disposable ; the camerawork turgid . \\nthe heartbreaking thing is that it makes independence day look like a masterpiece . \\n',\n",
       "  b\"let me start off by saying that leading up to the release of the latest bond film , i really wasn't looking forward to it as much as i have with some of the previous films . \\ni'm not sure if it was the fairly lackluster trailers or the ever-present dread that the next film will fall back into the miserable ways of the timothy dalton years . \\ni'm happy to report that any doubts were erased after about the first 10 minutes of the film . \\nby that point , it was evident that mr . bond was back with a vengeance . \\nall doubts would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes of the film weren't exactly a pleasant experience . \\nit seems that nobody told the geniuses working at the theater that the house lights are supposed to be turned off when the movie starts . \\nit took a reminder from an audience member to clue them in . \\ni guess they can be excused though , taking tickets and cleaning up popcorn between shows is extremely taxing on the brain . \\nanyway , after somebody remembered what the light switch was for , i settled in for bond . \\ni think the most noticeable aspect of this , the 19th film in the series , is that it really goes back to the almost tongue in cheek style of the roger moore films . \\nthere were probably more one-liners in this movie than in the last several combined . \\nand bond's last one-liner in the film is about the best of the series . \\nthe world is not enough also contained perhaps the most action of any movie of the series . \\neverything from wild boat chases to the usual assortment of cool bond gadgets trotted out just when there seems to be no way out for 007 . \\nfor the most part , the action sequences worked very well . \\nalthough , there were a couple of times that i thought some things were a bit over the top , even for a bond film . \\ni think some of the blame can be laid at the feet of director michael apted . \\nwhile he did a good job for the most part , there were points in the movie , specifically during action sequences , that he seemed to loose site of the fact that he was making essentially an action film . \\nmost noticeably sequences on a snow covered mountain and one involving bond getting through a closing door looked like apted thought he was filming some sort of high brow art movie . \\nhe almost seemed like he didn't know what he was doing . \\nbut they were brief scenes and really shouldn't take away from the otherwise solid job that apted did in directing . \\nif you have ever seen a bond film , you won't be shocked to learn that plot has never been their strong suit . \\nthe world is not enough is no exception . \\nthis time we have yet another over villain that bond has to stop for the good of the world . \\n007 matches wits with the terrorist renard ( robert carlyle ) , a man who has a bullet lodged in his brain that makes him impervious to pain . \\nwhy this point is included is beyond me . \\nthey took great pains to explain his condition , but it only came up later in the movie as a scene that can only be described as looking like an afterthought . \\nanyway , renard , like the typical terrorist that he is , is bent on some harebrained scheme involving a mid-east oil pipeline . \\ni guess world domination just isn't as attractive to terrorists as a money making venture anymore . \\nbond is brought in to protect the pipeline's owner , elektra king ( sophie marceau ) , who is the daughter of one of renard's recent victims . \\nalong the way , bond has to enlist the help of a nuclear scientist , dr . christmas jones ( denise richards ) , and his old rival valentin zukovsky ( robert carlyle ) . \\nlike all bond films , you basically just have to suspend disbelief over the plot , since it is ridiculous beyond words . \\nmy biggest complaint would be that it was about the most disjointed of any of the bond films . \\nthere was at least one point that i had to stop and try to remember why bond was where he was and why he was doing what he was doing . \\nthe buddy that i saw the movie with was completely confused over an earlier kidnapping of marceau's character . \\nit was alluded to earlier in the movie briefly -- although not included in the film . \\nlater , it became a big part of the story and left him with the distinct feeling that he had missed something . \\nbut because it is a bond film , the beautiful women and nifty gadgets seem to make you forget about script problems quite quickly . \\nafter all , it isn't shakespeare . \\nhow about the cast ? \\nbrosnan seems to get better with each of his appearances as 007 . \\ni grew up with the roger moore version of bond , so i really enjoyed the lighter style that brosnan brings to the character . \\njudi dench , as m , had a bigger role in this film than in her two previous appearances in the role . \\nshe brought the talent with her that one would expect from an oscar winner . \\nrobbie coltrane was easily one of the best parts in goldeneye , so it was nice to see his russian mobster character revived in this movie . \\ncoltrane gets more screen time , which simply leads to him stealing even more scenes . \\nthen there are the bond girls . \\nsophie marceau might be one of the most beautiful actresses working today . \\nthere is just something about her breathtaking eyes that makes her a natural to play the innocent victim . \\nthose that saw her in braveheart know she is more than just a pretty face . \\nmarceau may be the most talented actress to ever play a bond love interest . \\nthen we have denise richards . \\nthere was no doubt in my mind that she was cast exclusively for her looks . \\nand after you see the outfits she wears , you won't have any trouble guessing what part of her anatomy caught the producer's eyes . \\ni was pleasantly surprised to find that she really did a good job playing a nuclear scientist . \\nadmittedly , there was one point that the audience snickered a bit at one of her technical lines of dialogue , but other than that she stacks up ( no pun intended ) to her bond girl predecessors nicely . \\ni must say that the biggest disappointment was robert carlyle's character . \\nwhile carlyle did a fine job with the material that he had , his character just never worked for me . \\nthe producers tried very hard to add more complexity to his character , but it just never quite got off the ground . \\ni guess i was hoping for a bit more regarding the whole impervious to pain aspect of his character , but the writers decided to play up the emotional side of his character . \\nthis might have worked well in another movie , but i don't go to see bond movies for their deep characterizations . \\nlast , but not least , we have desmond llewelyn as q . this is the 17th appearance for llewelyn as bond's gadget guy , and he is as good as ever . \\nalthough his screen time has grown far more limited in the past few films , he is still a treat to watch . \\nrumors abound that this may be his last appearance in the role . \\nhe says future appearances are up to a higher power . \\nthe producers have introduced his protege and future replacement , a bumbling and somewhat pompous character played by comedy master john cleese . \\nwhile we don't see much of him in this film , i think it is fair to say that desmond llewelyn's legacy , whenever it is passed on , will be in very capable hands . \\nso how does it stack up ? \\ndespite some problems , the world is not enough is a very entertaining movie . \\nand , all things considered , what problems it does have are small compared to some that have plagued earlier bond movies . \\nthis is easily the best of the brosnan films . \\nit may even be the best of the entire series , certainly in the top 3 . \\none thing is for sure , even after 19 movies , there is still plenty of life left in the james bond series . \\nhere's looking forward to bond number 20 . \\n\",\n",

       "  b'one of the indicator of badness in film is the hype being remembered more than film itself . \\nsuch was the case with boxing helena , 1993 directorial debut of jennifer chambers lynch , daughter of the great david lynch . \\nmade in the dying years of post-twin peaks lynch craze among movie snobs , it was hyped as another , \" warped , twisted masterpiece \" of lynch clan . \\nkim basinger also provided extra publicity by quitting the lead role and being sued for the breech of contract . \\nbut , the result was extremely disappointing film , which quickly sank into well-deserved oblivion . \\nthe movie protagonist is nick cavanaugh ( played by julian sands ) , talented surgeon who is getting obsessed by helena ( sherilyn fenn ) , beautiful woman who ditched him after brief affair . \\ncavanaugh stalks her and uses every opportunity for the pathetic attempts to re-establish the relationship . \\nduring one of such occasions , helena is hit by a car , and nick quickly takes the role of her personal physician in order to have his way with her . \\nafter she wakes up , helena discovers not only that she is prisoner in cavanaugh\\'s stylish residence , but also that cavanaugh amputated her legs in order to prevent her from escaping . \\nshe is still trying to escape , so cavanaugh takes off her arms . \\napart from casting sherilyn fenn ( audrey horne in twin peaks and small cameo in wild at heart ) and the use of twisted characters and their perverse fantasies , this film by ms . lynch hasn\\'t got anything in common with the works of director\\'s more talented father . \\ndespite rather bizarre subject , the style of this film is conventional and setting is light , characters are beautiful - but the result at the end is quite sterile and the film in the end looks too artificial for dark sexual fantasy it was supposed to portray . \\njennifer lynch obviously lacks talents in directing and it becomes painfully obvious in the scenes that are supposed to erotic - its banal artificiality is even bellow the standards of playboy videos . \\nthe actors aren\\'t good either . \\njulian sands is terribly miscast as emotionally disturbed man - this actors is best either when he plays charismatic protagonists or villains ; being neurotic doesn\\'t suit him . \\nbill paxton was better for this role , but his presence was wasted in forgettable and unnecessary subplot dealing with helena\\'s boyfriend . \\nsherilyn fenn contributed to this film mostly by her looks , but even the her greater effort in acting couldn\\'t help this film . \\nthe screenplay , on the other hand , is awful , at least for someone who had made best-seller with laura palmer\\'s diary - the events in this movie are implausible , characters come and go without purpose and many unnecessary subplots only slow down the film and add to the total confusion . \\none of those subplots involves character of cavanaugh\\'s \" regular \" girlfriend , played by betsy clarke . \\nthe twist at the end , although unpredictable , is unbelievable and the viewers , who had the stomach to endure entire film , would feel cheated . \\nall in all , boxing helena is disorganised quasi-artistic mess of a movie that should be remembered as nothing more than one of the wiser decisions in kim basinger\\'s career . \\n',\n",
       "  b'synopsis : a mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy from a potentially fatal accident and then falls in love with the boy\\'s mother , a fledgling restauranteur . \\nunsuccessfully attempting to gain the woman\\'s favor , he takes pictures of her and kills a number of people in his way . \\ncomments : stalked is yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurned-psychos-getting-their-revenge type movies which are a stable category in the 1990s film industry , both theatrical and direct-to-video . \\ntheir proliferation may be due in part to the fact that they\\'re typically inexpensive to produce ( no special effects , no big name stars ) and serve as vehicles to flash nudity ( allowing them to frequent late-night cable television ) . \\nstalked wavers slightly from the norm in one respect : the psycho never actually has an affair ; on the contrary , he\\'s rejected rather quickly ( the psycho typically is an ex-lover , ex-wife , or ex-husband ) . \\nother than that , stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable . \\nstalked does not provide much suspense , though that is what it sets out to do . \\ninterspersed throughout the opening credits , for instance , a serious-sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers and ponders what may cause a man to stalk ( it\\'s implicitly implied that all stalkers are men ) while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen . \\nafter these credits , a snapshot of actor jay underwood appears . \\nthe narrator states that \" this is the story of daryl gleason \" and tells the audience that he is the stalker . \\nof course , really , this is the story of restauranteur brooke daniels . \\nif the movie was meant to be about daryl , then it should have been called stalker not stalked . \\nokay . so we know who the stalker is even before the movie starts ; no guesswork required . \\nstalked proceeds , then , as it begins : obvious , obvious , obvious . \\nthe opening sequence , contrived quite a bit , brings daryl and brooke ( the victim ) together . \\ndaryl obsesses over brooke , follows her around , and tries to woo her . \\nultimately rejected by her , his plans become more and more desperate and elaborate . \\nthese plans include the all-time , psycho-in-love , cliche : the murdered pet . \\nfor some reason , this genre\\'s films require a dead pet to be found by the victim stalked . \\nstalked is no exception ( it\\'s a cat this time -- found in the shower ) . \\nevents like these lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker and stalked , where only one survives ( guess who it invariably always is and you\\'ll guess the conclusion to this turkey ) . \\nstalked\\'s cast is uniformly adequate : not anything to write home about but also not all that bad either . \\njay underwood , as the stalker , turns toward melodrama a bit too much . \\nhe overdoes it , in other words , but he still manages to be creepy enough to pass as the type of stalker the story demands . \\nmaryam d\\'abo , about the only actor close to being a star here ( she played the bond chick in the living daylights ) , is equally adequate as the \" stalked \" of the title , even though she seems too ditzy at times to be a strong , independent business-owner . \\nbrooke ( d\\'abo ) needs to be ditzy , however , for the plot to proceed . \\ntoward the end , for example , brooke has her suspicions about daryl . \\nto ensure he won\\'t use it as another excuse to see her , brooke decides to return a toolbox he had left at her place to his house . \\ndoes she just leave the toolbox at the door when no one answers ? \\nof course not . \\nshe tries the door , opens it , and wanders around the house . \\nwhen daryl returns , he enters the house , of course , so our heroine is in danger . \\nsomehow , even though her car is parked at the front of the house , right by the front door , daryl is oblivious to her presence inside . \\nthe whole episode places an incredible strain on the audience\\'s suspension of disbelief and questions the validity of either character\\'s intelligence . \\nstalked receives two stars because , even though it is highly derivative and somewhat boring , it is not so bad that it cannot be watched . \\nrated r mostly for several murder scenes and brief nudity in a strip bar , it is not as offensive as many other thrillers in this genre are . \\nif you\\'re in the mood for a good suspense film , though , stake out something else . \\n',\n",

       "  b'studio expectations must not have been high for \" great expectations \" -- the film\\'s release date was pushed from late december to late january at what appeared to be the last minute , therefore putting any academy awards chances it has off until this time in 1999 . \\nit\\'s actually a smart move , because while this updated take on the charles dickens tale isn\\'t quite oscar fodder , it * is * strong enough to be distinguished from the cinematic dumping ground that usually makes up the first five or six weeks of any given year . \\n \" great expectations \" also demonstrates how to modernize a classic story right , especially after the excruciatingly wretched excesses of baz luhrmann\\'s \" william shakespeare\\'s romeo + juliet . \" \\n \" great expectations \" opens somewhere in 1970s florida ( the original story is set in 19th-century england ) , as eight-year-old finn ( jeremy james kissner ) meets a trio of people who will have a profound effect on his life in the future . \\nthere\\'s icy , 11-year-old estella ( raquel beaudene ) , a pseudo-playmate of finn\\'s ; ms . dinsmoor ( anne bancroft ) , estella\\'s auntie who\\'s quite off-kilter over a past romance that never took off ; and a mysterious prisoner ( robert de niro ) whom finn saves the life of . \\nfinn , who lives with his sister\\'s affable boyfriend ( lone star\\'s chris cooper ) , fancies himself an aspiring artist , and proves his prowess by whipping up an unusual portrait of estella using only ms . dinsmoor\\'s lipstick , eyebrow pencil and the wallpaper from her dilapidating mansion . \\nflash forward into the \\'90s ( after a brief stop in the \\'80s ) , and finn ( now played by ethan hawke ) , despondent over a strange hot-and-cold relationship with the elusive estella ( gwyneth paltrow ) , receives quite a bit of money from an unknown benefactor ; it\\'s enough cash to send him to new york to focus on a career in art . \\nthere , finn seems to gain everything he could ever want -- wealth , prestige and a high place in the glamorous art world . \\nwhen estella resurfaces -- albeit with an aloof fianc ? ( hank azaria ) -- finn also sees the chance to renew their mutual attraction . \\nbut she\\'s not the only ghost from finn\\'s past that\\'s going to be paying him a visit . \\ncomparisons with the afore-mentioned \" romeo + juliet \" seem inevitable since these films are the only ones in recent memory to plop classic drama into a current setting . \\n \" great expectations \" is a much better venture , though , because it treats its source with even-handed respect , where \" romeo \" was never quite sure whether to be a spoof , a homage or both . \\nthe movie is a visual banquet thanks to emmanuel lubezki\\'s sexy cinematography ; notably , he captures a revisited fountain kiss between the two leads with a luscious , erotic charge that\\'s steamier than the film\\'s ( surprisingly muted ) love scenes . \\nthe eclectic rock soundtrack compliments the on-screen action beautifully , especially new songs by tori amos , mono and duncan sheik . \\nacting credits are first-rate , often hiding the screenplay\\'s occasional slip-ups . \\nhawke is sincere and solid as a leading man ( something we also learned from \" gattaca \" ) , and his finn is quite a likeable guy . \\npaltrow\\'s estella , on the other hand , is rather underdeveloped . \\nwhile the actress is at her icily seductive best , we\\'re not told very much about her character , and as a result , it\\'s often hard to understand why finn would appreciate her beyond a physical level ( but , oh , * what * a physical level ) ; sometimes , we root for finn although we don\\'t quite understand why she\\'s fueling his fire . \\nrobert de niro is nice and sophisticated in the benevolent kind of role he rarely gets to play ; on the other end of the acting spectrum is bancroft , a macabre , throaty delight who mambos and sucks down cigarettes with an eerie enthusiasm that would make norma desmond jealous . \\nalfonso cuaron\\'s visually elegant direction helps to distract from the dry moments that pop up more frequently around the movie\\'s climax . \\nanother problem is predictability ; you can guess your way through the plot even if you aren\\'t familiar with the story . \\ndespite its script flaws , though , \" great expectations \" is undeniably romantic without being corny or gloppy . \\nand frankly , it\\'s nice to see a film that embraces softened sensuality other than explicit sexuality . \\nperhaps that renovated release date , awfully close to valentine\\'s day , will end up helping \" great expectations \" \\' seemingly average box office chances after all . \\n',\n",
       "  b\"you've seen this moment before , recently : a particularly troubled character senses danger of the paranormal kind when the room temperature inexplicably plummets to below freezing . \\nthe difference is that when it happens to lili taylor's nell in the haunting , we don't care . \\nthe hero of the sixth sense , a young boy named cole , is a rich creation , and we wish nothing more than for the ghosts who haunt him to take a hike . \\nthe seasons have changed since an ex-patient shot jaded child psychologist malcolm crowe ( willis ) in the comfort of his own bedroom . \\ndesperate to get his career back on track , even at the expense of his crumbling marriage ( to williams , of rushmore ) , malcolm councils the deeply troubled cole ( osment ) . \\nthe preteen displays all the quirks of malcolm's would-be killer : scars on his body ; antisocial behaviour ; and the reluctance to reveal a big secret . \\nonly after cole is locked in a closet by some bullies ( and hospitalized as a result ) does he divulge to malcolm , in a spine-tingling scene , that he sees dead people walking among us , all the time . \\nmalcolm assumes , and given his profession , reasonably so , that cole is schizophrenic , not psychic , but the sincerity in cole's anguished confession prevents the doctor from taking drastic measures . \\nhe will instead pursue the supernatural angle , becoming a kind of surrogate father to cole ( who lives with his single mother , lynn ( collette ) ) in the process . \\nthe sixth sense has more in common with ghost than poltergeist . \\n ( though shyamalan does , somewhat unforgiveably , crib the self-rearranging kitchen business from the latter . ) \\nit's far more heartwarming than frightening , and the film would be none the worse for wear without its few pulp shocks . \\ncole attracts the dead for reasons unknown , but they're not out to harm him , really-they just want to be heard , even if it means scaring the bejesus out of the innocent gradeschooler . \\nperhaps the apparitions seem more ghastly to us , at first , than they really are because we're looking at the situation through the eyes of an eight-year-old . \\nthat's right : willis , for the first time in years , gives up the spotlight to his costar . \\nwe appreciate malcolm's domestic dilemma , but we identify with cole , recalling our fears of the bogeyman or the closet monster or the thing under the bed . \\nboth actors deliver immensely likable performances , and their dynamic is manifest . \\nwillis convinces us that he's a doctor , something he was unable to do as a horndog shrink in the overheated color of night . \\nosment is phenomenal , a true professional who resists mugging for the camera like some child stars with too much experience in television commercials do . \\nthe sixth sense ( atmospherically shot by the silence of the lambs' cinematographer , tak fujimoto ) is actually a drama-its spooky , effective ad campaign is misleading . \\nonly because i was expecting something different did i notice-rather , feel-the movie's running time , which is just shy of two hours . \\nthe story unfurls slowly but engrossingly ; its unexpected finish is definitely worth the wait . \\ni'm not sure said big twist ending is bulletproof , but i admired its audacity . \\n\",\n",

       "  b'i don\\'t know how many other people have had the idea cross their mind that their life could be an ongoing television show watched by another world of people , but it\\'s something i used to wonder about when i was younger . \\ni can\\'t decide if i first thought it because i watched a lot of tv or because my brother hit me in the head with a baseball bat , but i\\'m pretty sure andrew niccol , screenwriter for the truman show , has had the same curious thought . \\nthe truman show is about a man ( jim carrey ) whose entire life has been engineered by a corporation and marketed to the public . \\nsince birth , he\\'s been living in the fictional island town of seahaven , fla . , which actually exists as a giant domed set just beyond the hollywood sign . \\nall the people in truman burbank\\'s life are actors , and the anonymous townfolk paid extras . \\npeople watch truman\\'s life 24 hours a day , live , with no commercial interruptions . \\nrevenue comes instead from product placement , a staple of contemporary hollywood , with truman\\'s friends and relatives describing their consumer items in cheerful and optimistic tones . \\nthe sun rises and sets on cue and everyone likes everyone else . \\neven if you haven\\'t seen the truman show , you\\'ve probably learned most of the crucial details from the commercials , the trailer and other promotion blitzes . \\nif anything i\\'ve written so far is a surprise to you , then i pity you for making me a primary source for your entertainment news . \\neither way , you should probably know the premise of the truman show going into it , because otherwise you\\'ll probably think it sucks . \\nit begins with jim carrey looking into a mirror , reciting the crucial \" eat me \" scene from alive , wishing his neighbors a good day , afternoon and evening , and living in domestic bliss with his wife ( laura linney ) . \\nbut weird things start happening . \\na stage light comes falling out of the sky , truman hears people tracking his movements on the radio and he swears he sees his dead father . \\nwe learn through a flashback that his father drowned when truman was a child , sailing through a rainstorm . \\nthe death was staged by director christof ( ed harris ) , who wanted to put a fear of water into truman to keep him from leaving the island . \\nsimilar cruel manipulations keep him from stumbling upon the truth , not the least of them truman\\'s best friend marlon ( noah emmerich ) , who assures him he\\'s not in on any conspiracy because the last thing he\\'d ever do is hurt him . \\nas truman\\'s trusting eyes tear over , christof fades up emotional synthesizer music for a worldwide audience of people who apparently never watch anything else . \\nthere\\'s even a daily behind-the-scenes update from harry shearer that captures the highlights of truman\\'s existence . \\nthe key to a movie like this is in finding the right balance between humor and drama , because a premise like this has its obvious implications in both directions . \\nand it all hinges on carrey , who has to balance comic naivet with a real sense of longing and drive to find out what the hell is going on . \\nhe\\'s come a long way from talking butt cheeks in ace ventura . \\nmost fundamentally , it\\'s just plain interesting to follow along as director peter weir shows us just how they can capture a person\\'s life without the person realizing it -- how they coordinate extras , hide cameras and feed automatic lines to actors . \\nthe most interesting thing about the truman show is that most of us can probably imagine some ambitious director pitching a show like this . \\nsure , the most interesting tv genre of the \\'90s has been reality programming and jerry springer\\'s popularity is through the roof , but those people deserve to be humiliated for turning their intimate details over to the airwaves . \\nand when news shows use hidden cameras , it\\'s done in the name of the greater good , not entertainment . \\nbut merge the two and you\\'ve got the truman show . \\nright now , it\\'s implausible -- i mean , the fcc won\\'t let you say the s-word on the air ; do you think they\\'d let you broadcast every detail of a man\\'s life to the entire world without his consent ? \\none day , though , it could happen . \\nand , even though it would mean the end of privacy , people would eat it up . \\nyou know they would . \\n',\n",
       "  b'capsule : the weakest and least engaging of the alien movies , dragged down by an uninvolving story and no real tension . \\nalien 3 ( the \" 3 \" should be in superscript ) is a sad and wan entry in what was shaping up as one of the best sf sagas ever put on screen . \\nit continues the story of ripley , the space-trucker-turned-impromptu-survivalist , but seems remarkably uninterested in her . \\nin fact , the movie seems lucky to be interested in anything at all , it\\'s so elegaic and limp . \\na little of this would have been nice for atmosphere , but the movie telegraphs its own tragedy from the beginning . \\nat the end of the last film ( aliens ) , ripley and two survivors were on their way home . \\nunfortunately , an alien pod had been deposited in their ship , and wound up triggering off their ejection in an escape pod . \\nthe pod crashes on firorina 161 , a prison planet designed to house the incurably criminally violent . \\nripley lives through the crash ; the others do not . \\nthe prison is a grim place , even as prisons go -- it\\'s been built around the remnants of an abandoned steelworks , which provides no end of techno-gothic backdrops for the actors to be backlit against . \\nlice are endemic , and so ripley\\'s head is shaved ( another surreal touch ) . \\nat first it looks like she just has to hold out as an unwelcome guest until a company rescue ship can arrive , but it doesn\\'t stay that way . \\none of the other eggs on board the wrecked escape pod hatches , and soon a newly-gestated alien is running amuck . \\nworse , it looks like ripley herself has been impregnated . \\nwhat\\'s weird is how little tension this generates , except near the end , when the pressure is being troweled on through every cheap cinematic form of cheating imaginable : loud music , shaky camerawork , etc . sigourney weaver has become comfortable with the role , and she does well with it , but this time the role has been underwritten and left slack . \\nthe supporting actors are also not given a lot to do : the doctor ( charles dance ) and another , rather religious inmate ( charles s . dutton , very good ) , hiave presence , but they\\'re not asked to do anything with it . \\nin light of the impending sequel , which apparently plays fast and loose with the ending of this movie , i will not talk about the ending -- except to say that they found a remarkably good ending for such a drab movie . \\nit\\'s strange that some of the desperate and improvisational thinking that they found to wind up this story couldn\\'t have driven the rest of it . \\n',\n",
       "  b'a frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal . \\na soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nation-state against another . \\na common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain . \\na terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end . \\nif the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy , the violence continues . \\nit is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone ( even total innocents ) , anywhere , at anytime that gives the figure his label . \\nedward zwick\\'s the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states . \\nyou\\'d think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines . \\narab terrorists kill american citizens abroad , and the u . s . responds by retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack . \\nhowever , unlike the real-life tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin laden\\'s camp and manufacturing facility , the film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal . \\nin retaliation , the terrorists bring the fight to the new world . \\nunwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agent-in-charge anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , who works out of the bureau\\'s new york office at one federal plaza . \\nwhile investigating a series of bombings in the big apple , he encounters cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , also trying to uncover information . \\ngenerally , the fbi is charged with problems inside the u . s . , while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm . \\neven spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country . \\nhubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory , but as the two form a tentative professional relationship , hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government . \\nthe original tagline for patriot games was , \" there has never been a terrorist attack on american soil . \" \\nhowever true , it was pulled before the movie\\'s release because it sounded too much like a dare . \\nrevisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states , the siege is almost an invitation in itself , because it shows just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were to set up operations here in america . \\nadmittedly , the terror wrought upon new york is a bit excessive ( who\\'s going to believe that a few bombs are going to cause new yorkers to jump at the backfire of a bus or to curtail their shopping by two-thirds ? ) , but the basic premise is still valid . \\ni liked the fact that this film rises above the basic action-thriller fare of good guy g-men against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society and law and order . \\nit provides a very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of a few arabs would escalate into a series of hate crimes against the arab-american population , and that in an effort to find the terrorists , the civil liberties of the minority may be violated by the government itself . \\nin fact , about halfway through the film , when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city , the liberties of all americans are put at risk . \\nalthough it may actually be a side effect of a terrorist campaign , the demise of social order in america is a scary thought and a goal which would not be beneath many international terrorist groups . \\nthroughout , the film maintains a conflict between hubbard , who wants to use the fbi to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law , and general devereaux ( bruce willis ) , who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully . \\nwhat results is a fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act , utilizing philosophy and historical examples to make points on both sides . \\nit actually gets rather heady at times , but it\\'s a credit to screenwriters zwick , lawrence wright , and menno meyjes that they don\\'t underestimate the intelligence of the audience . \\ni don\\'t know if it\\'s his tone or inflection or something else , but denzel washington has a way of spitting out dialog that makes whatever he says sound great . \\nthis , combined with his innate acting ability and his experience in playing the mid-level authority figure , makes his performance in the siege convincing and enjoyable . \\nannette bening gives one of the more assertive portrayals of a female character i\\'ve seen recently , and the chemistry she shares with washington is palpable . \\nit\\'s somewhat unfortunate that her character\\'s fortitude is broken at a certain point , but it allows us to watch bening play a little more range . \\nbruce willis is pretty much relegated to a tough-guy role , always standing straight , and with a permanent scowl fixed upon his face . \\nhowever , the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard is a major drive behind the film\\'s development . \\nnotable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad , a lebanese immigrant . \\nthe role calls for evidencing both a kind of filial pride for his heritage , and contempt for those of his own race who might interfere with his integration into the american society . \\ndifficult to say the least , shalhoub does it with a naturalness you can almost reach out and touch . \\nperhaps best known for his role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom \" wings , \" shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic abilities in the wonderful film big night . \\nwhereas denzel washington seems to be edward zwick\\'s favorite actor ( he directed washington in glory and courage under fire ) , james horner seems to be his favorite composer . \\ni therefore found it odd that zwick chose the prolific score-writer graeme revell ( seven films this year already ) over horner for the siege until i realized that this film contained a lot of arabian-themed music , and horner\\'s record has shown more of a propensity for scores either neutral in ethnicity or irish-sounding at most . \\nrevell does a good job at providing appropriate music to punctuate key scenes and allowing the score to enhance the movie as a whole . \\nit\\'s nowhere near as intrusive as in some of the other films we\\'ve been getting throughout the year . \\nmissteps in the siege can be found in a couple of the excesses it takes . \\nfor example , it\\'s pretty clear throughout that the film is meant to be more of thriller than an action flick . \\nunfortunately , there\\'s a scene where the army just cuts loose against some arab immigrants in a blatant display of firepower and explosions , obviously meant for the sole purpose of being eye-catching . \\nin the middle of the city ( and against no real opposition ) , zwick even has the army use a cobra attack helicopter to shoot rockets into a building no farther than 50 feet from friendly troops . \\nverisimilitude really goes out the window at that point . \\nthe film also gets a little preachy toward the end , focusing on the ability of different races to get along . \\na noble gesture , the film just puts the message across a bit too obviously . \\nthese flaws are glaring , but they don\\'t detract too much from an otherwise good film that makes you think about issues you may not have considered since history class . \\n',\n",

       "  b' \" gattaca \" represents a solid breakthrough in the recent onslaught of science-fiction films -- it\\'s a genre picture that doesn\\'t rely on alien creatures or loud explosions to tell its story . \\nthe movie takes place in a futuristic world where babies are created through genetic tampering and not sexual reproduction . \\nthis allows parents to predetermine what kind of eye color , intelligence and life span they\\'d like for their child , and also eliminates most pesky chances of health defects . \\nthose made the old-fashioned way are labeled as \" in-valids \" and confined to the lower rung of society . \\nvincent freeman ( ethan hawke ) is one such person , born not too long before the genetic process was perfected and forced to grow up in a home with his petrie dish-molded younger brother anton . \\nfed up with being second-rate and enchanted by dreams of one day traveling through space , vincent leaves home and takes a janitorial position at the gattaca aerospace corporation . \\neveryday , he watches as \" superior \" folk make his fantasy a reality . \\ndetermined to do the same , vincent meets a dna broker ( tony shalhoub in a funny cameo ) who sells fake identities to in-valids . \\nhis counterpart for this scam is jerome morrow ( jude law ) , an ex-athlete left paralyzed in an accident and confined to a wheelchair for life . \\nfor a price and the promise of a caretaker , jerome supplies vincent with his identity , as well as blood , skin and urine samples for all of those pesky on-the-job tests and physical examinations -- this future is one where employees clock in by pricking their fingers instead of punching a time card . \\nbecause of his drastically improved status , vincent is quickly propelled to a high position in gattaca , and catches the eye of comely co-worker irene ( uma thurman ) on the way -- obsessed with her own minor heart defect , she\\'s enamored by his flawless persona she doesn\\'t know is a lie . \\nbut on the figurative eve of his upcoming planetary departure , the mission director is murdered . \\ntwo ardent detectives ( alan arkin and billy bathgate\\'s loren dean ) determine the killer is on the inside of gattaca , and the sole clue they find at the crime scene -- one of vincent\\'s eyelashes -- threatens to blow vincent\\'s cover and derail his goal . \\neven if \" gattaca \" were dramatically empty , it would still boast a sublime set of production credentials -- the film\\'s look is dazzling without ever being flashy . \\nfirst-time director/writer andrew niccol ( he also wrote the screenplay for the upcoming jim carrey drama \" the truman show \" ) demonstrates a keen eye for the stylish ; his collaboration with cinematographer slawomir idziak , production designer jan roelfs and costume designer colleen atwood result in a sophisticated composition that emanates classy , retro ambiance . \\nan opening credits sequence -- where skin , nail and hair fragments fall in slow-motion through a colored camera lens -- displays these combined talents uncannily . \\nniccol even utilizes voice-over narration ( a device almost always poorly-employed ) in an effective way . \\nwhen it comes to acting , the movie is also flawless . \\nethan hawke does magnificent work , proving his ability to carry a film and reaffirming his enormously high charisma level . \\nhis chemistry with thurman is a bit on the icy side , but needfully so , adding to the setting\\'s clinical chill . \\nas the bitter jerome , jude law has a star-making presence , and it\\'s his scenes with hawke that give the movie its fine emotional core . \\nin \" gattaca \" \\'s series of final shots , the fates of vincent and jerome are superimposed over each other , and the effect is sad , lyrical and beautiful . \\nthings get a little strange as the movie nears its climax , when vincent\\'s relationship with his brother comes back into view . \\nthe big dramatic culmination is a swim race , which is somewhat silly albeit beautifully photographed . \\nstill , the single most surprising aspect of gattaca is its use of backdrop -- it\\'s successful sci-fi without showy special effects , it\\'s a crisp thriller with character-driven thrills , it\\'s a futuristic fable without blood and guts . \\neven its murder mystery is relegated to a secondary subplot , ensuring that a smart story about smart people and smart science takes center stage . \\nalthough it\\'s portrayal of the upcoming century is grim , \" gattaca \" serves up one of the most thought-provoking societal forecasts ever depicted on film . \\n',\n",

\\nhow did civilization change so rapidly ? \\neveryone has horses : where did all they come from ? \\nthe \" law of eights \" that bethlehem lives by seems to have its origins somewhere beyond the film , but where ? \\nare we to believe that the rest of the world is in the same shape and hasn\\'t made their way west to help or conquer ? \\nthere is some jumbled symbolism here that doesn\\'t appear to make sense . \\nthe tale is obviously saying that communication can defeat evil in much the same way that the internet has the potential to topple governments , but beyond that there are some oddities . \\nthe evil army is called \" holnists \" which sounds coincidentally like the new age \" holism \" , but why ? \\nis it another coincidence that it takes place in 2013 , just one year after many ancient prophesies ( including the ending of the mayan calendar ) predict a new world for mankind ? \\nwhy is the general named \" bethlehem \" ? \\nthere seems to be some reason for that , but what ? \\nsometimes the movie feels like a joke . \\nan army of postal workers armed with guns ? \\nconsidering the headlines of recent years , it takes a tremendous leap of faith to cheer for these guys . \\nit\\'s even more difficult to accept those re-powering the federal government as the heroes . \\ngiven the current climate of the country and the distrust of big government , it\\'s asking a lot for the audience to get behind the film\\'s nationalism . \\neven with its numerous flaws , the movie all comes together , if only for those who have the same weaknesses that i have . \\nit\\'s doubtful that \" the postman \" is going to find much of an audience , but a few of us are going to have a good time . \\nbesides we\\'re all awaiting the fall of civilization caused by the year 2000 millennium computer bug . \\n ( michael redman has written this column for over 22 years and would like to announce that the \" michael redman \" arrested near indianapolis last week for accepting an illicit package from federal express is , to the best of his knowledge , not him . \\nperhaps this similarly-named person should have used kevin costner\\'s postal service . ) \\n',\n",

\\nno , but i expected something . \\na funny joke . \\na clever prank . \\na plot development . \\nanything . \\nthe movie never delivers . \\nyou\\'ve got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing . \\n \" detroit rock city \" is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film\\'s existence , and it\\'s not a very satisfying realization . \\nthe film is about four teenage boys , all huge kiss fans from cleveland , trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit , michigan . \\nthat\\'s it . \\nthere is no big plot description in this review , because the movie has very little plot . \\nthe characters are hawk ( edward furlong ) , lex ( giuseppe andrews ) , trip ( james debello ) , and jam ( sam huntington ) . \\nthey have a garage band . \\nthey\\'re pathetic , like all garage bands , but they like kiss and they like rock n\\' roll , so i guess that means we root for them . \\nthey have tickets , they lose them . \\nthey get more tickets , they lose those too . \\nthey come up with crazy schemes to get tickets , most of which backfire . \\nthere\\'s not much more to it . \\nfrankly , it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film , when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys\\' hands , only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity . \\noh , and jam ( real name jeremiah ) has a really , really annoying ultra-religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency . \\nshe doesn\\'t want them to see kiss , if you hadn\\'t figured that out already . \\nit\\'s really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this . \\nwe\\'ve got plenty of kiss , along with some ac/dc , ramones , and thin lizzy . \\nthen again , \" maximum overdrive \" had an awesome soundtrack ( me being the big ac/dc fan that i am ) , but is probably one of the worst movies of all time . \\n \" detroit rock city \" doesn\\'t quite reach that level of ineptitude , but it gets dangerously close . \\nin fact , the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind . \\nbasically , the soundtrack has earned the film a full half-star , which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back ( except for marilyn manson , whose half-hearted cover of ac/dc\\'s \" highway to hell \" sounds like something my neighbor\\'s cat coughed up ) . \\nit\\'s also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste , because it\\' s evident that they\\'re all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie . \\nedward furlong has done far better work than this , and so has natasha lyonne , and so has lin shaye , but hey , they\\'ve got to make a living in hollywood . \\npeople wanting to see kiss , and lots of it will probably be disappointed , considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song . \\ntoo bad , they might have provided some energy to this mess . \\ndirector adam rifkin knows he hasn\\'t got much material to work with , so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning . \\nwe get an endless parade of quick-cuts , split-screens , zoom-outs , zoom-ins , and rotating cameras , all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script . \\nit\\'s fun for a while , but eventually it becomes disorienting . \\ni would recommend that those who felt seasick at \" the blair witch project \" stay far away from \" detroit rock city , \" because the witch has got nothing on this baby . \\ni haven\\'t felt such an urge to reach out and hold the camera still since \" armageddon . \" \\nand what about that script ? \\nit\\'s written by carl j . dupr ? , which sounds like as made-up a name as i\\'ve ever heard . \\nif it is , i can\\'t say i blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible . \\na plotless , pointless rock n\\' roll movie can be fun , if the jokes and gags are actually funny . \\nthe jokes in \" detroit rock city \" rarely are . \\nin fact , the only time i really laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuana-laced pizza , and that was just because it was so surreal . \\nthe rest of the movie just seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it \" comedy . \" \\nthere is no set-up , just a succession of punchlines that don\\'t provide for much in the way of chuckles , precisely because there was no set-up . \\nit\\'s as if they just whacked someone on the head , pointed at him and said , \" see ? \\nfunny ! \" \\nlook , that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink . \\nsee ? \\nfunny ! \\nlook , that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver . \\ntwice . \\nsee ? \\nfunny ! \\nlook , that kid has been vomiting for 20 minutes after drinking an inordinate amount of alcohol and is now about to perform an exotic dance for money . \\nsee ? \\nfunny ! \\na word of advice to mr . dupr ? : no , these things aren\\'t funny all by themselves . \\nthey must be preceded by a clever set-up so the audience hasn \\'t predicted them five minutes in advance . \\nthat\\'s it , i\\'ve said enough about this movie . \\nit\\'s a waste of time and money . \\ni liked the music , but don\\'t bother buying the soundtrack . \\ni hear it\\' s just modern bands doing inferior versions of the songs that are actually in the movie . \\nyou want to see this concept executed well ?

       "  b'in roger michell\\'s romantic comedy notting hill , william thacker ( hugh grant ) leads a rather dreary life maintaining his flagging travel bookshop in the quaint section of london which lends it\\'s name to the film\\'s title . \\none day , american movie superstar anna scott ( julia roberts ) walks in to purchase a book on turkey . \\nquickly enamored of each other , the two embark upon an on-again , off-again love affair replete with romance , humor , and the occasional lump in the throat . \\nthe film opens with a non-verbal cue to anna\\'s stardom as the title credits appear over a montage of slow motion sequences featuring the actress\\'s appearances in films and at premieres - coming out of limousines , walking the red carpets and such . \\nwithout words , this sequence gives us a background to her character . \\nfollowing , however , is a set-up narration by william indicating what he does and where he lives . \\ni don\\'t know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we couldn\\'t have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film , and which never resurfaces after the movie\\'s beginning , but there it is . \\nif there were ever a clear case for \" less is more , \" this would be it . \\nthe film is told nearly first person from william\\'s point of view , as he is in every scene . \\nby nature of this arrangement , we get a very definite sense of what he is all about , and his nice guy personality wins us over easily . \\nin fact , much of notting hill\\'s strength lies in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis . \\na scene where william is still in shock over the fact that he\\'s even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honey-soaked apricots from his refrigerator . \\nor take an instance where anna kisses william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image . \\nwilliam assures her he wouldn\\'t say a word , then adds , \" well , i\\'ll probably tell myself now and then , but i\\'d never believe it . \" \\ngreat stuff . \\nthe downside to spending so much time with william is that we don\\'t get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible . \\nwe\\'re constantly exposed to william\\'s thoughts , feelings , actions and desires , but don\\'t actually get the sense of how much anna really feels for him . \\nthere are a couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest , but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that we\\'re not sure what she\\'s been thinking all the times in between . \\nthis , combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two , makes this hugh grant\\'s film hands down . \\nhe gets the great scenes ( look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna ) , the great lines , and gives an overall wonderful performance . \\njulia roberts fans will probably be disappointed by the actress\\'s top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film ( ala sandra bullock in a time to kill ) along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her character\\'s unpredictable behavior . \\nanna doesn\\'t get a lot of our compassion . \\nthis romantic comedy leans a little more toward the comedy than the romance , much of it supplied by grant himself , but with considerable help from the supporting cast . \\nmost notable is rhys ifans as spike , william\\'s eccentric roommate , who is in the film for no other purpose than to make us laugh . \\nhugh bonneville , emma chambers , james dreyfus , and gina mckee bring up the guard as william\\'s friends and family , particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sister\\'s birthday dinner , and we get to see how these common folks react to the presence of a movie star in their midst . \\nit\\'s a scene most of us will probably think would play out in our own living rooms were we faced with a similar situation . \\nroger michell\\'s use of visuals doesn\\'t sweep us off our feet , but does give us more than your typical movie of this type . \\nfor example , there are a couple of instances in this film where large amounts of time pass . \\nwhereas some films are content to simply put in a caption saying \" eight months later , \" michell presents us with more interesting cues , such as william\\'s walk though his neighborhood while the seasons change around him . \\nanother memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred feet in the air . \\nwe\\'re generally used to scenes where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so , but in this case , the camera just keeps going up and up until we have a bird\\'s eye view of the ground below . \\nmusic is used rather glaringly as an enhancement to many of the film\\'s scenes , and some of this might have been better toned down , but in other areas it works to full effect . \\nit\\'s kind of a mixed bag , but still fares better than many of today\\'s lighthearted movies which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video . \\nat least this film has some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate . \\nnotting hill\\'s grant and roberts will not go down in history as one of the all-time greatest film pairings , but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it . \\nfor a couple of hours , you should expect to laugh more than cry , and that\\'s not so bad , now is it ? \\n',\n",

\\nshould this guy be forced to do something he doesn\\'t want to do ? \\nthis appears to be one of the million questions in this film , which is jam-packed with greatness , but does not have the totally brilliant whole it should . \\ni\\'m not saying \" good will hunting \" is a bad film at all . \\nit\\'s a very enjoyable film with tons of great moments , and lots of great things about it . \\nthe acting is amazing , with two oscar-nomination-worthy performances from damon and williams , who have amazing chemistry together . \\nwe also get some great support from stellan skarsg ? rd ( great name ) , ben affleck , and from minnie driver , who plays will\\'s love interest , skylar . \\nthere are tons of individual moments that i adored . \\ni loved all the comedy in the film , especially a scene where damon proves a schmuck out of a college student who is quoting a historian to impress some chicks , his various attempts at therapy , and of course , my favorite scene in the entire film , the one where he delivers a long , exstensive rant to some nsa agents about the downside of working for them . \\ni liked the relationship between some of the people , like will and skylar , will and sean , sean and lambeau , and will and his friends . \\nthere are scenes between them which are just amazing to watch . \\nand there are even moments in the film which are so honest in their portrayal , that i felt rightfully uncomfortable . \\nlike the break-up scene between will and skylar , will and sean\\'s first meeting , a bar scene between sean and lambeau , and a scene where sean tells in detail how he doesn\\'t regret meeting his first wife , who would later suffer a slow , painful death , and leave him lonely and slightly bitter . \\nhowever , the main flaw of the film is there\\'s too much of everything , and not enough of it either . \\nthe film tries for deeper relations between the characters , but they\\'re sometimes either overwritten or underwritten . \\ntake for example the relationship between sean and will : the film gets an interesting father/son as well as doctor/patient relationship going with out any problems , but when it tries to show them as equals , it falls on its face . \\nwe hear how they went to the same town , and there are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical both of them are at times . \\nbut this never takes off like the other parts of their relationship do . \\nalso , will\\'s relationship with his best friend , chuckie ( affleck ) , has a nice climax , but not enough rising action . \\nwe see them joking around , but when chuckie arrives at a decision between the two of them , it seems more like a superficial reasoning than a more selected one . \\ntheir relationship never goes beyond \" just best friends , \" and his decision just seems to be a generalization of any two best friends instead of something more . . . human . \\nmaybe it was just me . \\nand it also goes for a parallelism with the relationship between sean and lambeau , but that , again , is underwritten . \\nand , of course , as in most films like this , the girl/boy relationship is pretty underwritten . \\nwe never understand what they see in each other , so when skylar confesses that she loves him , it seems more like it\\'s there for plot details that anything else . \\nminnie driver is interesting , though , and breathes life into her character . \\nthe writing is a bit at fault here , but what makes all this worthwhile is the little moments in the film where it acheives true awesomeness . \\nsure , it feels overstuffed , but it\\'s extremely enjoyable . \\nthe dialogue that affleck and damon have written is amazingly fresh , and seems extremely human . \\ni think that they should get a nomination for their script chiefly because of the dialogue , which is amazing . \\nwhile this is probably director gus van sant\\'s most conservative film ( you\\'d hardly know it\\'s the same director of \" to die for , \" the only van sant film i\\'ve seen , really ) , it\\'s still a pretty remarkable film , albeit a tad overrated ( what\\'s this \" best picture \" deal ?

       "  b\"the sequel to the fugitive ( 1993 ) , u . s marshals is an average thriller using it's association with the fugitive just so it can make a few extra bucks . \\ntommy lee jones returns to his role as chief deputy samuel gerard , the grizzly cop who was after harrison ford in the fugitive . \\nthis time , he's after fugitive mark sheridan ( snipes ) who the police think killed two fbi agents , but of course he's been set up , and when the police plane escort he ( and gerard ) are riding crashes , he makes a run for it , gerard not so hot on his tail . \\nwhat follows is about 2 hours of action , brought to us by the director of executive decision ( 1995 ) , another film curiously involving a plane . \\nwhen comparing this movie to the fugitive , the prequel is far superior . \\nbut even on it's own , u . s marshals is a pretty lousy movie . \\nwhile the original was reasonably intelligent , and had a fugitive to root for , the audience feels strangely distanced from snipes fugitive , mainly because we know so little about him until way into the film's overlong running time . \\nwhile the fugitive gave a little time to develop harrison fords character , u . s marshals is straight in there , pulling it's trump card ( the place crash ) almost immediately . \\nto be honest , i couldn't care less if snipe's character got captured or not . \\nsnipes performance is average , and his character gets surprisingly little screen time ( considering he is the fugitive ) for reasons i'll explain later . \\ntommy lee jones is as fine as ever , although his role is hardly a challenge . \\nthe sense of deja vu was overwhelming . \\ni know it's the same role from the fugitive , but there is seemingly no attempt to develop his character from the last film . \\nthere's a few 'nudge nudge' references from the first film , but apart from that , nothing . \\nnobody even mentions harrison ford in this movie . \\ndowney jnr is ok as fbi agent john royce who's roped into the chase , and sexy french actress irene jacob wanders in and out of the movie as snipes wife . \\nnobody looks as if their having a good time , and all the performers are on autopilot . \\nthe supporting cast are o . k , but when it comes to performances , u . s marshals falls flat on it's face . \\nit doesn't fare any better plot-wise , either . \\nthe film starts off with gerard trying to capture snipes , but then veers off into terrorists territory . \\nas said above , the film is an normal , average terrorist thriller , seen a million times before , but is using the fugitive reputation to make it sound more professional . \\nif this film wasn't the 'sequel' to the fugitive , this would probably go straight to video , or not even been made at all , because it's so average . \\nand because of the film's plot changing it's course , snipes is almost forgotten apart , and hardly features in the movie . \\nstuart baird , the director , is all right , but there's no particular scene that stands out . \\nit's director is the usual action movie style . \\neven the plane crash is sorely lacking in tension . \\nthe special effects are nice , especially the plane crash , and there's a good ( if very loud ) soundtrack by veteran composer jerry goldsmith . \\nbut in the end , u . s marshals suffers from an overwhelmingly lack of excitement . \\nsure , it's loud and dumb , but in the end u . s marshals just ain't fun . \\nbored performers and a lackluster plot and script , do not make a good action movie . \\noverall rating= review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities \\n\",\n",

       "  b'with the success of the surprise hit alien , directed by ridley scott , a sequel was inevitable . \\nin fact , after watching the first film , a sequel was wanted , particularly by this reviewer . \\nhanding over the director\\'s chair to recent box office gem james cameron , who had only made two films previous to this one ( pirahna ii , a surprisingly dull film , and terminator , making cameron a household name ) , the alien series got a face-lift of immense proportions . \\ninstead of being a suspense/science fiction film , cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture . \\nwhat results is one of the most terrifying films ever created . \\na film like aliens comes along only once in a while , and when it does , audiences are usually unprepared for it . \\ni never saw this movie in theaters , but i wish i could have . \\nthe terror and fright must have been unimaginable , most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear . \\naliens is an action film unlike any i have ever seen . \\nwith a science fiction plot , cameron gives aliens added testosterone , pumping up the action and fire power from the original film . \\nin fact , aliens is one of those few sequels which tops the original . \\nperhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the hero--or heroine , as the case may be . \\nnever have we had a more sympathetic hero in an action film , and never have i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character . \\nsigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who could play this character and make her realistic enough for us to care about . \\nplacing a woman in these situations would sometimes seem unusual , but because of weaver\\'s presence , a woman is the only suitable hero . \\naliens begins 57 years after alien ended . \\nlieutenant ellen ripley ( weaver ) is discovered in hypersleep on the nostromo and is awakened . \\nshe explains how she is the only survivor of her past encounter with the aliens , but \" the company \" is doubtful . \\nthey explain that a colony of families is flourishing on the same planet from which she just left . \\ndespite stern warnings from ripley , the company remains rigid and won\\'t call the families back . \\nhowever , when the company loses contact with the colony , ripley\\'s story seems much more feasible . \\none of the company\\'s directors , carter burke ( paul reiser ) , wants to gather a team to travel to the planet . \\nthis team includes a buff private vasquez ( jenette goldstein ) , a questionable corporal hicks ( michael biehn ) , and a loyal android bishop ( lance henriksen ) . \\nburke tags along with ripley as they fly to the planet in order to locate the members of the colony . \\narriving on the planet , the team finds most of the human life extinguished in a cocoon-type environment . \\nthe only survivor is 12 year old rebecca \" newt \" jorden ( carrie henn ) . \\nripley finds this a chance to be the mother she never had the opportunity to become , and she becomes newt\\'s surrogate mother . \\nripley and newt are the only ones who knows what has happened , and soon , all hell breaks loose . \\naliens not only multiplies the thrills and suspense from scott\\'s version , it also multiplies the number of aliens in general . \\nalien focused on one alien in particular which systematically killed each crew member , except ripley , who managed to jettison the alien out of the nostromo . \\naliens focuses on an entire race of these aliens , and as a result , the chills are incredibly heightened . \\nthen again , this is james cameron , the guy who has given us true lies and terminator 2 : judgment day . \\nhe is the best action director out there ( topping renny harlin , who directed cliffhanger ) , and only he could create something as terrifying as this film . \\nit seems that every alien film seems to have some memorable scene or scenes , and aliens has the motherload . \\nwith perhaps one of the most astonishing endings ever created for an action film , aliens climax never seems to hit until the viewer is nearly pushed to extreme exhaustion . \\ni can\\'t recall another film ever to sustain this level of intensity throughout , never dropping for a moment . \\njust when you think the movie is over , something else will occur , and it starts right back up again . \\nwith a seemingly endless conclusion , aliens ends with one of the greatest moments in film history . \\nthis scene is usually the one remembered most from the film , as lieutenant ripley steps into one of the lifting machines to fight the alien queen . \\nusing flawless special effects , the climax is exhausting , leaving any audience member drained from extreme anxiety . \\nof course , for a film of this genre to work properly , the technical aspects must be realistic enough for us to believe what we see . \\naliens is completely realistic , even a decade after its initial release . \\nthe special effects are wonderfully seamless , with a terrifying alien to go with them . \\none of the most overlooked aspects of this film is the music , composed by cameron-regular james horner . \\nhorner has created a terrific score , receiving an oscar nomination for his work . \\nnot only that , horner has also created one of the best scores for any action film , or science fiction film ever ( and that includes 2001 : a space odyssey , which was mainly a compilation of well-known composers ) . \\nin fact , the climax music is also some of the most recognized of film music . \\nthe production design is incredible , which also happened to snag a nomination from the academy . \\ndark corridors lit by red lights are very impressive , but more impressive is the amount of terror which arises from well-lit locations . \\nnormally a film will be very dark in order to scare a viewer ; aliens uses lights to scare the viewer . \\nthen , of course , is the cinematography , which uses point of view shots , along with video feeds in order to build suspense . \\nsome of the scariest scenes involve the perspective of ripley . \\nsurprisingly , the acting is not only above average for this genre , but some of the best . \\nsigourney weaver received an oscar nomination for her portrayal of ripley , incorporating the right amount of sympathy into her hard-edged persona . \\nweaver soars above the rest in this film , but she is supposed to . \\ncarrie henn gives an above average performance for a child , developing a three-dimensional character from her quiet attitude

       "  b' \" desperate measures \" was something i was excited about seeing back when it was originally scheduled to be released : summer \\'97 . \\nfor some reason , it was delayed until hollywood\\'s traditional dumping ground : january . \\nnow that it\\'s out , i see no real reason for that delay , as it\\'s a simple yet highly entertaining film . \\nmichael keaton stars as a maniacial murderer who\\'s bone marrow can save the life of the dying son of a san francisco police detective ( garcia ) . \\nkeaton agrees to the transplant , only so he can attempt escape . \\nhe succeeds , in a plan that of course could only work in the movies . \\nthe police force is now trying to kill keaton , while garcia is working against them trying to keep keaton alive in order to save his son . \\nthe film definately has it\\'s flaws . \\nthe plot is strictly tv movie of the week fare , but the acting and direction certainly boost it far above that status . \\nalso , after keaton\\'s escape , garcia\\'s captain barks at him \" how many men have to die to save your kid\\'s life ? \" \\nwhich the film treats as such an evil and insignificant remark . \\nthe thing is , it\\'s a vaild point . \\nhow many people have to be needlessly crippled , burned , and killed just to save this one child ? \\nwhat\\'s the greater good here ? \\nmany lives or one life ? \\nif movies really had guts nowadays , i would have loved to have seen this movie come down to a final choice for garcia\\'s character . \\nplace him in a situation where he knows that he has to kill keaton because keaton is about to kill someone else . \\nalas , movies these days generally have no such ambition to pull the audience\\'s strings in ways which might make the uncomfortable . \\ndespite a few silly moments ( and one or two really stupid ones ) , the good things about \" desperate measures \" outnumber the bad . \\nthe main highlight would be keaton\\'s performance . \\nthe character could have easily been an overacting , scene chewing freak , but keaton underplays it nicely . \\nhe\\'s not as menacing as he was in \" pacific heights \" or even as menacing as he was in \" batman \" ( yes kids , batman used to be a dark character ) , but you certainly get the idea that he\\'s evil . \\neven the final scene of the film , which normally i would just hate , seems strangely appropriate for this film . \\nso much so that i didn\\'t mind it in the slightest . \\nand another bonus : the film takes place in san francisco , which usually means a car chase on those hills that you\\'ve seen a billion times before . \\nand for a moment , it looked as though it was about to happen . \\nbut it doesn\\'t , and that\\'s creative . \\n[r] \\n',\n",

       "  b'i am a steven seagal fan . \\ni only say this now because \" mufti splenetik \" isn\\'t my real name and because i probably need to explain why i went into this film expecting great things . \\nany proud seagal fan worth his beans will tell you that the seagal formula is something you can depend on . \\nseagal films can always be counted on for minimal dialogue , heaps of expendable baddies with extemely crunchable bones ( which we\\'ll always hear when seagal does his limb-twisting thing ) , rarely a female co-lead in sight ( unless it\\'s a real-life model-wife who hasn\\'t worked since weird science ) and , usually the worst possible titles you can imagine . \\nnot to mention very straightforward plots , generally all-round bad dialogue and mr implacable leather-face himself in that same black outfit he\\'s been in since nico doing his \" my hands are sharp , nimble knives \" thing , seagal the stoic , sir petrified ponytail , duke of dull . \\nin the glimmer man , seagal breaks out of this formula : he gets a * sidekick * , attempts to banter , and puts on a new vest . \\nhe\\'s also put on quite a lot of weight . \\nsmall potatoes , you may say , a man should be able to accessorize and banter if he wants to , but damnit , if it ain\\'t broke , why fix it ? \\n ( more on this disappointed person\\'s dashed expectations later ) . \\nas jack cole , seagal is a homicide detective with a questionable past . \\nwhile he and his partner ( played by keenen ivory wayans ) are investigating a series of ritual killings , cole himself becomes a suspect , especially when a background check run by campbell reveals practically nothing on cole . \\nit turns out that cole is a former trained government assassin ( you just can\\'t trust these homicide detectives ) , someone whom victims used to catch just a glimpse of in the jungle before he pounced on them , and hence , well , you know , that \" glimmer man \" thing . \\nan increasingly fishy homicide investigation in the present soon leads to the gradual uncovering of a larger , more threatening conspiracy that involves a crooked businessman ( bob gunton ) , cole\\'s former cia boss ( brian cox ) and deals involving chemical weapons . \\nthe glimmer man plot is pretty standard stuff , drawing ( as with his other films ) elements from the hotter films of the year ( eg , se7en ) . \\nit\\'s the other changes that disappoint . \\nfor example , although there\\'s a fair amount of violence in this movie , there\\'s also the disastrous pairing of seagal with keenen ivory wayans , probably the best known of the wayans tribe ( how many are there , exactly ? ) from television\\'s \" in living colour . \" \\nwayans plays whiney straightman to seagal\\'s bead-adorned and brocade-draped cole , keeping up his \" are you crazy \" part of the dialogue with wasted zest . \\nas campbell , wayans confines himself to bemoaning his new partner\\'s eccentric habits , but the chemistry between the two is minimal , and seagal\\'s wooden comebacks make for painful watching . \\na cook in under seige 2 , seagal is now a buddhist who speaks chinese and wears prayer beads and intricate silk jackets over his normal black ensemble . \\nhe chants , refuses to fight unless truly provoked and introduces campbell to powdered deer penis to cure his allergies . \\nagain , a benign ( if trite ) plot device except for the fact that these new character traits require seagal to speak more than usual . \\nheck , he has to deliver punchlines and carry a steady conversation with someone other than himself for a large part of the film . \\nis that a lot to ask of the seague ? \\ntoo much . \\nseagal\\'s best characteristic used to be that he knew his purpose in this already complicated world of movies : to crunchily snap off bad guy appendages , and to do it silently , and alone . \\nnot for seagal , the snappy one-liners of arnold and stallone , nor the attempts to show that he can act , much less think . \\nno kindergarten cop , no oscar , just simple , unadulterated deathblows . \\nthat\\'s really how it must have started : like-minded fans who knew what they wanted streamed in to watch the seague do his thing , knowing that never in the seagal universe would they ever have to see him do anything else . \\nwe trusted him . \\nwe got to know him . \\nnow , betrayal . \\ni don\\'t know if i can watch another seagal movie without that little niggling doubt that he\\'s going to try to be funny again . \\ni\\'ll try , but it won\\'t be easy . \\nif you haven\\'t watched the glimmer man yet , you might want to wait for the video to come out . \\nit\\'s easier to just fast forward the dialogue parts and linger on the action sequences . \\nafter all , if we can\\'t depend on our fantasies , what can we depend on ?

       "  b'studio 54 attracted so many weird and bizarre people to its gates that it\\'s a wonder why the film about the life and death of the studio centers itself on one very boring , cliched individual , not to mention an ensemble of people who wouldn\\'t be at all fascinating unless they worked at the studio , which they did according to this film . \\nare we supposed to believe that out of all the strange folk who populated the studio nightly , that a character who is a bland ripoff of tony manero would really make a good protagonist for the film about it ? \\n \" 54 \" belongs in the elite group of films known as \" the big disappointments \" : the films that attain so much hype and/or so much potential in its creation that they come off worse than they are when they are finally finished . \\ni was heavily awaiting \" 54 , \" not the least because i\\'ve become fascinated with the infamous club , which has been the subject of an engrossing documentary that\\'s been running all summer on vh1 , which is , weirdly enough , much more intriguing and engrossing than this \" edgy \" film . \\nperhaps more importantly , \" 54 \" is part of the blossoming subgenre , \" the 70s nostalgia film , \" which has been picking up mighty steam , what with \" boogie nights \" and \" the last days of disco \" coming out within the year , and both being such damn good movies that not only captured the feel of a certain time period ( the late 70s party and the early 80s wakeup period ) , but brought us interesting and real characters , like scotty , the tragically gay boom mike operator from \" boogie nights , \" and charlotte , the ironically clueless and bitchy co-protagonist from \" the last days of disco , \" not to mention several others . \\n \" 54 \" deals not so much with the timeline of the studio ( how it began , how it was run , how it ended ) - that\\'s all dealt with in the narrated opening and finale - but more interested in the characters who populated it . \\nthis is a definite plus . \\nhere\\'s a film that could have been a fascinating 2 hour plus film about the tragic people who went there to party , and had to wakeup in the 80s when things like diseases , economy problems , and perhaps worst of all , reagan , all hit and forced everyone into a rude awakening . \\nthe story of the studio is tragedy in itself : let\\'s look at how it all affected the people . \\nbut this film doesn\\'t let that happen . \\nit gives us a half-assed protagonist named shane o\\'shea ( ryan phillippe , from \" i know what you did last summer \" ) , who\\'s chief character trait is the fact that he\\'s from new jersey , which also happens to be his chief character flaw ( i guess ) . \\nhe\\'s dim-witted , into being part of \" the scene , \" and soon finds he\\'s become a bit of a rave amongst the studio regulars . . . a \\nbit like \" saturday night fever , \" \\'cept no travolta and no real interest put into him . \\npoor , poor phillippe struggles to make him interesting , but all he is a half-assed character and not at all our ticket to the glimpse of the decadence going on inside the club that he could have been . \\nshane begins to hang out with some other denizens of the club , like anita ( salma hayek ) , a wannabe donna sommers , and her young hubby , greg randanzo ( breckin meyer , from \" clueless \" ) , who helps shane become a bartender and rise to a bit of fame . \\nalthough he begins to get somewhere when he sleeps with the foxy billie auster ( sela ward ) , an exec of sorts , he falls in lust with a soap star named julie black ( neve campbell ) , and thus the boring romance subplot that\\'s all too not necessarily important to anything else in the film and never really becomes interesting at any point in the film . \\nthe film\\'s sole point of interest and one major strongpoint is the all-too necesary personage of steve rubell , played by mike myers ( you heard me ) . \\nrubell , the famous head of the studio acted as if he never stopped partying ever , and is an easy metaphor for the life and times of his creation , but the film , thanks to a surprisingly strong performance by myers , makes him out to be more than that . \\nnotice the scenes sole shocking scene , where he tries to get felatio from one of his male employees in turn for a promotion : myers brings the humanity to rubell in this scene , and a couple others , that some of us who\\'ve only seen him on tv never saw , and proves to be perhaps the one aspect of studio 54 that this film actually nails . \\nfirst time feature director mark christopher proves that he\\'s a better director than a writer , though not too terribly much . \\nhis story is trite and shallow , as are his characters , and his direction is shockingly flat , especially for a film about this subject . \\nit\\'s as if he had a great story to tell , but instead opted for the easier route . \\nthe studio\\'s recreation is amazingly accurate , though , and very impressive , but his direction is never captivating enough . \\nsome people say that a film does its job if it makes you want to visit the locale it takes place in ( despite the film\\'s tone , i still want to go to rome and its many nightclubs after i saw fellini\\'s \" la dolce vita \" ) , and when i watched \" 54 , \" i didn\\'t particularly want to stay . \\n',\n",

       "  b\"to paraphrase a song title from an earlier disney movie , mulan is a whole new world . \\nthe mouse factory's latest feature is a treasure , featuring magnificent animation , a strong story and finely drawn characters . \\nmulan is the story of a fiesty , head-strong young woman who , unlike other disney heroines , isn't seeking her prince charming , \\nmulan's motivations are simple ; to save her father , serve her country and find a place for herself in a world in which females have no say . \\nthe story of mulan takes place in ancient china at a time when the huns have invaded the nation . \\nthe emperor has called for a conscription , one man from each family to join the army and defend the nation . \\nmulan's crippled father is called , but mulan sneaks off , steals his armor and takes his place . \\nmulan is a saga of courage and self-discovery . \\nyet , despite the grim backdrop of war , it is a lively tale of self-reliance and brain-over-brawn that even the smallest child can appreciate and enjoy . \\nthe movie utilizes a strong corps of asian-american talent as the voices for the main characters , including the wonderful ming-na wen ( the joy luck club ) as mulan , b . d . \\nwong as shang , mulan's commanding officer and later love interest , pat morita as the emperor and the veteran soon-tek oh as mulan's proud , but loving father . \\nalso adding to the proceedings is eddie murphy as mushu the dragon , sent by mulan's ancestors to watch over and help the young woman . \\nhis fast , wise-cracking , hip-talking mushu may seem out of place , but it's a crowd pleasing performance , especially for the youngsters . \\nthe movie features only a couple of songs , fewer than most previous disney animated flicks , but mulan's are winners . \\nthe music by matthew wilder and lyrics by david zippel fit nicely into the plot . \\nthe overall score by jerry goldsmith also is a plus . \\nmulan is a treat , more powerful than hercules , with more heart than the hunchback of notre dame . \\nat about 85 minutes , mulan moves rapidly , and will hold the attention of youngsters from beginning to the end . \\nmulan will set a new standard by which future animated efforts by disney and other studios will have to work hard to attain . \\nalso , it is hoped that the success of mulan , and there is no doubt that it will prove to be a popular vehicle , will spur an interest for more movies with oriential or asian-american themes so as to provide more substantial roles for the talented performers who gave their voices for this production . \\nit would be nice to see them on screen as well as hear them . \\ncommitted to lifelong learning through effective communication \\n\",\n",
       "  b'in 1994 , an insider\\'s look at a scandal-ridden run for the democratic presidential nomination ( closely based on clinton\\'s 1992 campaign ) was written anonymously ( former newsweek writer joe klein later claimed true authorship ) . \\nnow , the book , primary colors , has been made into a movie , directed by mike nichols , and , in light of recent presidential scandals , seems to be more relevant than ever . \\nbut the film is more than a diatribe against , or a paean in praise of , the president . \\nit is a fascinating look at the political machinery , and the ethical quagmire , that surround modern politics . \\njack stanton ( john travolta ) is the governor of a small southern state running for the democratic presidential nomination . \\nhe is charismatic , but has several flaws which threaten to doom his campaign , and strains his relationship with his wife , susan ( emma thompson ) . \\nthe film is told from the point of view of henry burton ( adrian lester ) , grandson of a civil rights leader , who is swept away by stanton\\'s ideals and helps to organize the campaign . \\nhe joins political strategist richard jemmons ( billy bob thornton , looking an awful lot like james carville ) , and campaign advisor daisy green ( maura tierney ) . \\ngovernor stanton\\'s past repeatedly pops up to haunt him , a fact that his chief rival , lawrence harris ( kevin cooney ) , consistently uses to his advantage . \\nto help clean up the stanton campaign , jack and susan bring in an old friend , libby \" the dustbuster \" holden ( kathy bates ) . \\nthe acting throughout primary colors is superb . \\nit would be worth seeing the movie for bates\\' wild performance alone . \\nshe enlivens the atmosphere with energy in a truly boisterous performance . \\ntravolta does a fair clinton impersonation as governor stanton , although his accent does stray a little . \\nemma thompson delivers a strong performance as his suffering wife who can\\'t let anything show that might hurt the presidential run . \\nthe problem with political movies is that they tend to alienate over half of their audience by promoting one side or the other , or else the movie is vague to the point of boredom . \\nprimary colors treads lightly on this issue . \\nthough stanton is clearly portrayed as a democrat , and there are a few minor barbs thrown in the way of republicans , the movie touches on few actual political issues . \\nin fact , most of the \" bad guys \" are fellow democrats on the same road to the white house . \\nrather than issues , the film is primarily concerned about scandals and spin control . \\nalthough the film strays into some obviously non-clinton territory , it is difficult to completely separate it from reality ( particularly when certain scenes seem to highlight the president\\'s current troubles ) . \\nprimary colors\\' chief problem is its length . \\nit runs about 15 minutes too long . \\nthere are some scenes which could have easily been cut . \\nfor example , midway through the film , the candidate gives a speech to an assembly of laid off machinists . \\nthe scene\\'s only apparent purpose is to establish stanton\\'s character , which has already been done in similar scenes earlier in the film . \\nthe extra length isn\\'t long enough nor tiring enough to be annoying , but it mars an otherwise excellent film . \\nrepublicans , democrats , and political agnostics should all be able to find something to like in primary colors . \\nit\\'s a funny , and at some times shocking , look at the modern political process . \\n',\n",

       "  b' \" deep rising \" gives you that sinking feeling both literally and figuratively : not only does the movie take place on a cruise ship slowly being immersed into the middle of the ocean by a squid-like menace , but the unfolding story is artificial , silly and almost completely derivative of countless other ( and , for the most part , better ) films . \\nwhile dumb monster movies can at least be decent guilty pleasures -- take , for example , the schlocky mountain highs of last spring\\'s \" anaconda \" -- \" deep rising \" has no tongue to put in its cheek . \\nfolks , we\\'re only a month into the new year , and already here\\'s a candidate for one of its stinkiest releases . \\nmost of the action takes place on the argonautica , a luxury liner in the middle of its maiden voyage ( uh-oh -- if these people had seen \" titanic , \" then maybe they\\'d have known to stay home ) when it\\'s attacked by a giant , tentacled sea creature . \\nthe only survivors are slinky jewel thief trilian ( famke janssen ) , argonautica owner canton ( anthony heald ) and a few other crew members . \\na mercenary team , lead by resourceful captain john finnegan ( treat williams ) , board the argonautica looking for assistance after their own boat breaks down nearby . \\nbut what their search of the ship uncovers is something blood-soaked , hungry and not very helpful . \\nthe main problem with \" deep rising \" is its overt familiarity ; the movie makes absolutely no attempt to differentiate itself from most sci-fi/horror films in recent memory . \\nthe concept is \" leviathan \" meets \" titanic , \" with a dash of \" speed 2 \" thrown in for good ( or is that bad ? ) \\nmeasure . \\nthis monster is equal parts \" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea \" and \" the relic , \" knows how to open doors like the raptors from \" jurassic park \" and even gets to expel a half-digested victim ( a neat effect , admittedly ) a la the giant snake in \" anaconda . \" \\nsome of the attack sequences are straight out of \" jaws \" and \" alien . \" \\na scene where the remaining survivors have to travel under water to escape death is right out of \" alien resurrection . \" \\nthere\\'s even a jet ski chase like \" hard rain . \" \\nand the list goes on . \\nwatching \" deep rising \" \\'s cast battle the beast is a murky chore in itself , because none of them have well-developed characters , nor do they seem to project even the slightest sense of fear when facing their enemy . \\nwilliams is affable enough , but his finnegan just isn\\'t believable . \\nan interesting supporting cast is thoroughly wasted ; pretty famke janssen , best known as \" goldeneye \" \\'s killer thighs , is trapped in a forced romantic interest with williams , while kevin j . o\\'connor , as finnegan\\'s mechanic , provides comic relief with screechy manic shtick that gets old fast . \\ndjimon honsou , who received raves for his performance as a noble slave in december\\'s \" amistad , \" pops up in a brief part . \\nhe needs to stay away from the water . \\nthe movie\\'s final shot is a groaner , as is the 11th-hour regurgitation of a subplot involving an on-ship saboteur . \\nas if a cast deserving of their snack food-fate isn\\'t bad enough ( when you taunt the monster , you\\'re really asking for it ) , \" deep rising \" is a slow , stupid slog through a story without a single bright spot . \\nand since we all know that the higher the casualty rate is , the closer we are to the end of the movie , rooting for this overgrown squid to swallow the whole ship isn\\'t out of the question . \\n',\n",

any civilization capable of receiving the transmission could build the computer , which would then engage in a real-time dialog with the aliens , exchanging information and technologies , and hopefully arranging to send back what it had learned . \\nabout thirty-five years ago , the bbc contracted with astronomer/writer fred hoyle and writer frank elliot to create the scripts for a mini-series called a for andromeda . \\nafa concerned the reception of a hoyle transmission , the construction of a huge computer , the computer\\'s analysis of life on earth , and its creation of an apparently human intermediary to facilitate communication . \\nshe was played with ethereally inhuman perfection by the then-unknown julie christie . \\naudience response was so strong that the bbc contracted for a sequel , andromeda breakthrough , which played to equally high ratings . \\ndennis feldman , whose previous credits include the golden child , has never been noted for coherent , well-structured movie scripts ; they start out great , and then disintegrate into a morass of chase and action , mitigated only by the presence of the obligatory beautiful girl . \\nfeldman writes good scenes , but has no idea how to tell a story or write a movie , even with a previous version to use as a model . \\nnow , in species , we have a mundane retread of the andromeda plotline , derailed by a preoccupation with removing the clothes from the leading lady and further ruined by a mediocre attempt to emulate several recent horror films in terms of splatter , gore , and chases . \\nspecies features ben kingsley , who is completely wasted in a badly-written portrayal of a feebly amoral scientist . \\nforest whitaker and alfred molina are also served poorly by the script . \\nthe species story is relatively simple ; we have been radioing information about ourselves and our dna out into space since 1971 , and have been receiving answers for two years . \\n ( note that , in the 1970\\'s , we really didn\\'t know diddly about the human genome structure , and were hardly in a position to radio out a set of blueprints for human beings . \\neven today , all we can do is give information about dna and how it works , not a copy of human dna , because we don\\'t have it analyzed yet . ) \\nthe answers we get from the unknown alien source are plans for recreating a member of the alien race , and doctor xavier finch , played by ben kingsley , is placed in charge of the attempt . \\nthe script begins to go off the deep end at this point , when the result is a beautiful young girl who can shape-shift into any of several ugly alien life forms . \\nthe first half of the film has something to offer , as \" sil , \" the alien girl , struggles with her multi-form existence , changing from beauty to lizard to giant cockroach and back again , all while trying to understand her own place in the cosmos . \\nshe seems oddly knowledgeable about human society , with glaring gaps where her social skills should be . \\nher instincts are to mate and procreate , and some of the best scenes deal with her attempts in this area . \\nescaping from her birth laboratory in utah , sil is pursued by a team of drafted civilians with orders to find her and kill her . \\nshe goes on an eating binge , spins herself a cocoon , and emerges as an adult , played by natasha henstridge , who goes a long way toward re-creating the sheerly inhuman beauty julie christie achieved in 1960 . \\nthe pursuers : michael madsen is an assassin/exterminator ;

       "  b\"written by john grisham and robert altman ( as al hayes ) \\ndirected by robert altman \\nsome time ago , a young director was given the opportunity to direct the screen version of a popular novel . \\nthe novel was a summer smash , topping best-seller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play the leads . \\nthe only problem : the novel wasn't very good . \\nit was far more pulp than pulitzer . \\nbut the director realized that , no matter how pedestrian the prose , this book really grabbed people - that the author , while not a great writer , was a fantastic storyteller . \\nso he took on the project , convinced he could make something happen on screen . \\nthe director ? \\nfrancis ford coppola . \\nthe book , of course , was mario puzo's the godfather . \\nthe rest , as they say in showbiz , was history . \\nby bringing up the godfather , i don't mean to suggest that robert altman's the gingerbread man is destined for that level of greatness . \\nbut the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema from questionable source material . \\ncan you get any more questionable than john grisham ? \\ndepends on whom you ask . \\nbut there's no question that grisham's work grabs people . \\nlike puzo , grisham is a better storyteller than a writer - unlike fellow hack michael crichton , who is a good idea man but who can't tell a well-constructed story from a can of spam . \\nso something in grisham's unpublished story of a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in a deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman , who at 73 years old remains one of america's greatest living filmmakers . \\nthe result is a gripping thriller that , while falling short of classic cinema , deserves its place in the altman canon . \\n>from its opening shot to the closing credits , the gingerbread man is permeated with a sense of dread , with a fear of the natural destructive forces of the universe . \\nthis terrific sense of mood is a classic altman touch . \\nwitness said opening shot : we see an aerial view of coastal georgia with its writhing , undulating landscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear . \\nwe roll over the hills into the town of savannah , then zoom in close on a red sports car speeding over a bridge while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone . \\nright away we know that the driver of that car is in for a few surprises . \\npay attention , boys and girls - this shot was not conceived by john grisham , but by altman . \\nthis is what a great director can do for questionable source material . \\nthe sports car belongs to rick magruder ( kenneth branagh ) , the aforementioned hotshot attorney who specializes in police brutality cases . \\nmagruder has just won a high profile case and celebrates that night with a catered party at his office . \\noutside after the party he meets one of the waitresses , mallory doss ( embeth davidzt ) , just as she realizes her car has been stolen . \\ndriven by southern chivalry , a driving rainstorm and his unspoken attraction to the fragile waitress , magruder offers her a ride home . \\nthere he learns more about mallory's life than he bargained for . \\nher car was stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon ( robert duvall ) , a ted kyzynski-style whacko who has been stalking and terrorizing his own daughter . \\nmagruder , perhaps influenced by mallory's decision to strip off her wet clothes in front of him , is sympathetic to her plight , and offers to help her get her father committed - right after he sleeps with her , of course . \\nthis simple offer of help leads magruder down a dangerous path with a black end . \\nhe succeeds in having dixon incarcerated in a mental hospital , and for a moment all appears well . \\nbut then dixon's crack team of homeless commandos bust him out of the lockup - and suddenly magruder finds himself , mallory and his own children in danger . \\nthe cops won't lift a finger to help a liberal attorney . \\nhis only allies are his faithful assistant lois ( daryl hannah ) and his bumbling private-eye sidekick clyde ( robert downey jr ) . \\nif this predicament wasn't bad enough , hurricane geraldo is bearing down on savannah and throwing the world into chaos . \\naltman may provide the atmosphere , but branagh's performance holds the gingerbread man together . \\nan accomplished actor when he isn't directing himself in vanity productions , branagh does a fine job of making rick a sympathetic hero while casting doubt upon his motives . \\nis his offer of help to mallory an act of kindness , or of egotism ? \\nmagruder is so sure of his place in the world that he never considers that he has bitten off more than he can chew until he has to swallow it - and by then it's too late . \\nas the plot unfolds , magruder learns that none of us are as secure as we think we are . \\nand life is never so bad that it can't get worse . \\nif you're familiar with altman's work , you'll recognize several of his signature techniques . \\ncharacters are not introduced in establishing shots , but rather are allowed to wander in the background of scenes until their importance becomes apparent . \\ncrucial scenes are shot from the outside through windows , making the audience unwitting voyeurs of the action . \\ndialog overlaps and the actors seem to slip naturally into an improvisational style . \\nand of course there's my favorite altman technique - the obligatory nude actress shot . \\nthanks to altman , here are some of the actresses i've had the pleasure of seeing naked : sally kellerman , julianne moore , madeline stowe , even frances mcdormand . \\nand now i can add embeth davidtz , who looks quite healthy in the altogether . \\nthe naked actress shot has become as ubiquitous to the altman film as the director cameo was to the hitchcock film . \\nis it old-school sexism , or a clever in-joke ? \\nyou be the judge . \\nbut back to the picture at hand . \\nin the hands of a mere mortal , the gingerbread man would have been a routine thriller , no better or worse than the countless others we've all endured . \\nin the hands of a master like altman , it becomes an exercise in existential doom , in its own way far more successful than scorsese's cape fear remake , which tried for the same result . \\nwhat may prevent it from enduring with altman's greatest work is a weak third act - in fact , there really is no third act in grisham's story , so it appears that altman had to throw in the hurricane just to jazz things up . \\nbut there are true moments of riveting suspense , and great performances by branagh , davidzt and downey jr - more than enough to see you through . \\nthat polygram so hated this picture that they tried to steal final cut from altman , and then buried the marketing campaign when he won it back , should tell you how utterly clueless of quality most studios are . \\nthey probably wanted it to look more like a time to kill . \\nand that , my friends , should make you very afraid . \\n\",\n",

       "  b\"although many people have compared this new gangster comedy to the hit hbo drama 'the sopranos , ' analyze this is witty and entertaining enough to be a good movie in it's own right . \\nbilly crystal plays wiseguy shrink ben sobol , who new 'patient' happens to be gangster boss paul vitti ( de niro . ) \\nben wants nothing to do with vitti , as he's about to get married to laura macnamara ( kudrow ) and having a gangster as a patient wouldn't really help . \\nbut ben is soon drawn into vitti worlds , and reluctantly helps vitti to sort his life out . \\nall done in a comic fashion , of course . \\nalthough never brilliant , analyze this is also never rubbish , which makes for a fun ride . \\nbilly crystal , who hasn't had a good role since city slickers way back in the early '90's , is given a role that lets him fully exploit his wiseguy act . \\nhe's pretty funny while he does it , and although his character is a little close to his character in city slickers , he's pretty funny . \\nrobert de niro is hilarious as vitti , playing it dead straight but coming off as really funny . \\nhe's a serious gangster unaware that he is a comic gold mine . \\nlisa kudrow , barely seen as crystals' estranged wife to be , basically reprises her phoebe role from t . v series friends , which is getting rather tiresome , and doesn't come off well on the screen . \\nthe supporting cast is apparently made up of the entire cast of casino and goodfellas , and are all funny caricatures , especially vitti's bodyguard jelly ( joe viterelli . ) \\nthe film genuinely plays like a proper gangster movie , but with laughs instead of hard ass talking . \\nit sometimes gets a little bloody for a light hearted film , but it strangely fits in . \\nspoofs are made of famous gangster movies , including a nice parody of the godfather . \\nthe italian tunes playing throughout the soundtrack contribute to the fun . \\nthere's also some odd plot points : fbi guys appear and suddenly disappear for no apparent reason . \\nit is true that analyze this has had a somewhat chequered production history , and perhaps the plot points were expanded in a earlier version of the script . \\nunfortunately , this is hollywood , so we will never know . \\nharold ramis , best known as egon from ghostbusters , has a deft touch with directing comedy , as shown in the immortal groundhog day , and the less immortal caddyshack . \\nall the comic potential in a scene is dug out and presented to the audience . \\nthe script , written by ramis along with peter tolan and ken lonergan , starts off funny , remains funny for the most of the film , but sadly peters out somewhat during the last twenty minutes where it wrongly enters more serious territory . \\nthe film is short , however , and just before audience interest is waning the film suddenly goes into a rather rushed and unsatisfying ending and the credits roll . \\nanalyze this is a good comedy , and is certainly worth watching . \\nrobert de niro sobbing is reason enough to watch it , even though it does seem forced , or like a parody ( although i think this was intentional . ) \\ncrystal is his most likeable in years , kudrow is given as little screen time as possible , which is a good thing , and de niro is just awesome . \\nit's no goodfellas , and it probably won't be remembered as much as groundhog day , but analyze this is a well done comedy that won't leave you feel cheated . \\n\",\n",
       "  b\"as with his other stateside releases , jackie chan's latest chopsocky vehicle , mr . nice guy , is contrived , blockheaded , and lacking in narrative logic . \\nbut also like those other films , it is a highly enjoyable ride . \\nonce again , chan's screenwriters ( here edward tang and fibe ma ) have taken the easy way out and named their star's character simply jackie , with no last name . \\nthis jackie is a world-class chef who co-hosts a popular cooking show on australian television . \\nof course , jackie also happens to be a talented martial artist , and these skills come in handy when he becomes involved in an ambitious reporter's ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) expose of a drug dealing ring . \\nother plot details , involving a videotape and a biker gang , are irrelevant ; in fact , as is the case with most chan films , the plot itself is just about irrelevant . \\nthe sole purpose of mr . nice guy's existence are chan's comic fight scenes , and those here do not disappoint . \\ndirector samo hung ( who has a cameo role ) , a longtime collaborator of chan's , does not waste any time putting chan in action , diving head-on into a wild chase/fight/shootout after a brief cooking show prologue . \\nother impressive set pieces follow , most notably a chase in a mall , which directly leads to some frenzied , if cliched ( can you say fruit cart ? ) , business involving a runaway carriage ; and an extended late-film sequence at a construction site , in which a hilarious pursuit through a maze of blue doors culminates in some exciting fights involving boards , cement mixers , and a deadly buzzsaw . \\nnone of the action sequences in mr . nice guy are as spectacular as supercop's thrilling helicopter-train finale or rumble in the bronx's daring leap between two buildings ; nor is anything as inventive as the ladder fight or air tunnel climax in first strike and operation condor , respectively . \\nbut the action delivers , even if the energy peters out before the film's end ( the finale , as spectacular as it is , is a letdown for fans of chan's athletic prowess ) . \\nfilmed almost entirely in english ( even so , the voices of some english-speaking actors are laughably dubbed ) , mr . nice guy hints at jackie chan's latest transition to hollywood productions ( he made ill-fated attempts with 1980's the big brawl and 1985's the protector ) ; next in the pipeline is rush hour , a stateside production co-starring chris tucker . \\nhopefully that film will be a mere diversion in tinseltown , and chan will continue with exuberant hong kong productions such as mr . nice guy , for his unique charm and reckless abandon are sure to be diluted by american hands , much like they have been before . \\n\",\n",
       "  b'i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x-files . \\nfirst , let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie . \\nthe producers are not stupid , making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable . \\nyou have to reach for a larger audience . \\ntherefore , the movie is quite user-friendly . \\naltough , non-fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange . \\nbut fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on . \\nyou will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera . \\nin any case , the answer is no . \\ni am not a fan of the x-files , i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium . \\nhowever , since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie\\'s opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie . \\ni taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie , i am glad to report that i learned nothing new . \\neverything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others . \\ni know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie . \\nwarning : major spoilers follow ! \\nplease do not read , to fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming , what exactly is over that hill and what that weird \" hummm \" sound is all about . \\nyou have been warned . \\nthe x-files is what a summer should be . \\nexciting , scary , great special effects ( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary ) and good performances . \\nthis is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank . \\nfrom start to finish , this movie does not let go of you . \\nwhen i compare it with last summer\\'s movies the best way to describe it would be : take the excitement and great score from face/off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon . \\nthis flick is scary , not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes . \\nin fact , the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue . \\nyou might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd ! \\nthe last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid . \\nyou know , when you are affraid to put you feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair , or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt ? \\nso yeah , the x-files is scary . \\nand guess what ? \\nyou never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed , computer generated , babyzilla , it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster . \\ndo not think that the x-files is a monster movie . \\nin fact , the creature is there for maybe three minutes total . \\nno , the x-files is definately a mulder episode of the series . \\nscully is at his side , of course , but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time . \\nshe has a couple of good scenes with duchovny , but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much . \\nno , this is mulder\\'s time in the spotlight . \\nby now , you have heard of the scene where mulder \" showers \" independence day . \\nif you have not then i will not spoil it for you , let\\'s just say that due to recent events mulder should be \" showering \" godzilla instead . \\nto those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there . . . who \\ncares ! ? \\nif he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about ? \\nthe dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous . \\nthe camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill . \\nthe script is spotless , every thing that happens happens for a purpose . \\nif you are confused by something , do not worry because it will all become clear later on but , and i cannot stress this enough , pay attention ! ! ! \\nunlike most summer movies , the dialogue is twice as important as the effects . \\nmiss one vital piece of information and , like most people who talk during movies , you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense . \\nalso , to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies . . . don\\'t ! \\nthe person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation . \\nthere is no time to take a breather between scenes because , again unlike most summer movies ( godzilla anybody ? \\n ) the x-files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots , every scene is crucial and serves a purpose . \\nwho needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a \" big emotional scene \" between godzilla attacks ? \\nso far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i\\'d recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose . \\nbut the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie , the x-files is . \\nwhat more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited ? \\ncool effects ? \\nit\\'s good some . \\npulse pounding ? \\nhell yes ! \\nstrangely enough , i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non-fans will have a good time . \\nit does not provide answers to the show\\'s many questions , the status quo remains nearly the same and , no , mulder and scully do not get together . \\nrating : four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer , several jump right out of your seat thrills , many \" whoah , i never saw that one coming ! \" \\nmoments , four \" holy shit , where the hell did that come from \" and one heck of an ending . \\nyou may wonder where this movie lost half a star . \\nwell , i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck , the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop . \\nit\\'s pretty obvious the film\\'s makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time , but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving . \\n',\n",

       "  b'we share the descent into darkness of a talented boy pianist . \\nyears later we see his subsequent resurfacing ; in the mid 80\\'s a damaged man walks out of a rainstorm and back into the world . \\nthe movie charts the causes of his mental breakdown . \\nbased on the life story of david helfgott , this australian film is a rich exploration of the pressures drilling in upon a child-genius , compounded by the looming shadow of a domineering father . \\nin the 1950\\'s helfgott emerged as a child prodigy . \\nthe film traces his relationship with his father , whose encouragement comes at the cost of demanding david have no life beyond that of the black and white keys . \\ndavid is offered places in the usa , but his father refuses to let him leave australia . \\nthe effect this has upon helfgott is cleverly told via a single reverse tracked shot ; david is sobbing on the front doorway of his music teacher\\'s house . \\nhe is well lit via the external house lights . \\nhis teacher isn\\'t home . \\nwe pull back and see that the dark front room\\'s window has it\\'s curtains open . \\nthere , in a pool of blackness , is a grand piano . \\ndavid\\'s fall over the dark cliff has begun . \\ninstead of being told in a linear mode , shine jumps around in time , ala \" pulp fiction \" . \\nthis narrative device works well ; we see david as a boy , teenager in london and mental-patient in various snippets . \\nthe film then neatly loops back for its uplifting conclusion . \\nadult-helfgott\\'s return to the light is told in linear fashion . \\nthe lead role is played by 3 different actors , with the teenage-david ( taylor ) and adult-david ( rush ) standing out . \\nwhilst rush is known for his tv work in australia , i think this is his first major cinema work . \\nhis david , whilst clearly damaged - he keeps quoting his \" daddy \" in a babbling word torrent , cuddles strangers and grabs women on the breasts - is both touching and funny . \\ntaylor\\'s teenage-david is the more sympathy producing role . \\nwe are mute witness to his gradual breakdown as the pressures just keep on building . \\nhis father wants him to play the very demanding rachmaninov\\'s 3rd , whilst his teacher wants to start him with a simple mozart . \\ntechnically this is a beautiful film and a lot of thought has gone in to the production . \\ni particularly like the use of slow motion and sound effects . \\none scene has adult-helfgott happily babbling in a car in the rain . \\nthe sound of the windshield wipers fades up over his voice . \\nwith a clever subtlety , the wiper sound appears to morph into a rhythmic thumping , but of the same beat . \\nthe image dissolves and we realise the thumping is the slow motion applause of a crowd . \\nbut it\\'s us being clapped . \\nwe are young-david walking up to the stage for our first public show . \\nthe music , as you would expect from a film of this subject matter , is critical . \\nand it works very well . \\nthe \\'miming\\' of the actors piano playing is faultless ( apparently rush didn\\'t mime ; he really did play ) \\nhelfgott\\'s life is certainly not without it\\'s sympathetic people . \\nindeed his return to the \\'normal\\' world is accelerated by his chance meetings with two very special women . \\nhis ultimately uplifting story is a magic piece of theatre craft . \\nit shows that with the \\'help of god\\' we can all find our way back home . \\n',\n",

       "  b'talk about a movie that seemed dated before it even hit the theaters ! \\nspice world is the feature film debut of the pre-fabricated pop band , the spice girls . \\nit\\'s intended as a sort of hard day\\'s night , but ends up simply hard to watch . \\nwhen watching the spice girls , i\\'m reminded of an old saturday morning cartoon trick ( such as from the smurfs , the snorks , or teenage mutant ninja turtles ) in which identically animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely by one personality quirk and a different name . \\nthe spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles , and about as talented . \\nthere\\'s ginger ( geri halliwell ) , the brainy one , sporty ( melanie chisholm ) , the athletic one , baby ( emma bunton ) , the childish one , posh ( victoria adams ) , the fashion-conscious one , and scary ( melanie brown ) , the one with a tongue pierced back so far you\\'re almost certain the post sticks out her throat . \\nthe film itself doesn\\'t really have a plot . \\nit follows the girls as they travel here and there , culminating at their \" first live performance \" at albert hall . \\nthe action , however , seems more like a hodgepodge of mismatched ideas . \\nthe various misfires include : an alien encounter , a fiendish tabloid editor scheming to wreck the spice girls , the shooting of a spice girls documentary , a movie producer ( george wendt ) trying to pitch various ideas for a spice girls movie ( nearly all of which , though incredibly far fetched , seem more plausible than the mess with which they ended up ) , a meeting with a pregnant friend ( whose sole purpose seems to be to maintain the film maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth before the movie ends ) , a boating adventure , a bus race , club-hopping ( wherein apparently no one notices the famous spice girls among the crowd . . . even \\nwhen they start to sing ) , and an assorted number of musical performances , press conferences , and general all-around celebrity stuff . \\nwhew . \\nfor some reason , the film is littered with star cameos . \\nfrom elton john to elvis costello , from bob hoskins to meat loaf . \\nheck , even roger moore shows up , though he can\\'t decide if he\\'s parodying himself as james bond , or if he\\'s lobbying to be the reincarnation of ernst stavro blofeld . \\nrichard e . grant has the largest secondary part , a thankless role of the band\\'s manager , clifford . \\nthe celebrity spotting is partially amusing , and a decent way to pass the time when confronted with the rest of the film . \\nneither amusing or spontaneous , when the spice girls are between songs they are deadly boring . \\ntheir songs are alright , but they play like lifeless adaptations of the music videos . \\nmy advice to fans is : stay home and watch that video collection , or at least spin that cd a couple of more times . . . either \\noption will be more enjoyable than the film . \\nnon-fans should know to stay well away from this one . \\n',\n",
       "  b'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \\nbe forewarned . \\nthe teaser trailers for my best friend\\'s wedding scarsely gave reason for hope - it looked like the sort of goofy , light-hearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight , but little more ; i\\'d frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often . \\nit was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friend\\'s wedding was such a success - a strong , bouyant romantic-comedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects , featuring a triumphant performance from ms . roberts . \\nthe heroine of my best friend\\'s wedding is julianne potter ( julia roberts ) , a successful new york restaurant critic , and we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes ( rupert everett ) that years ago , she had made a pact with her dear best friend and ex-lover michael o\\'neal ( dermot mulroney ) , a sports writer , that if they both hadn\\'t married by the time they reached 28 , they had promised to marry each other . \\nboth julianne and michael are both single , of course , and when george inquires about michael\\'s age , julianne realizes that he\\'s mere weeks away from his 28th birthday , and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day . \\nhowever , she finds herself even more distraught when michael\\'s call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace ( cameron diaz ) , and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding , julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael , and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary . \\nthe setup for my best friend\\'s wedding , then , is a fairly conventional one , and in many ways the film\\'s storyline is formulaic - but only to a certain extent : the film was directed by p . j . hogan , whose first feature , muriel\\'s wedding , had quite an offbeat tone for a traditional uplifting ugly-duckling story , and the same holds true for my best friend\\'s wedding , which confidently combines traditional romantic-comedy elements with a really eccentric sense of humour . \\nthe film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr . hogan . \\nfor example , there\\'s a heartfelt , emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the film - with a trio of teenagers , inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks , harmonizing in the background . \\nmy best friend\\'s wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film , and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect - it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a musical as woody allen\\'s everyone says i love you ; i\\'d even assert it\\'s a more successful one . \\nmy best friend\\'s wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well . \\nin a typical romantic-comedy , kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty , conniving ice queen , and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps ; this film is smarter than that - here , kimmy is sweet , sincere , and innocent ; julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmy\\'s life , she\\'d actually like her too . \\nthe george character is almost a staple of recent film - the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as a confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason - but in my best friend\\'s wedding , he gets to have a playful , mischievous and charming personality . \\nthroughout the film , the formulaisms one often sees is romantic-comedy are given little twists , and the result is a film which is compelling all the way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion . \\nthere is a lot of smart writing in the well-paced screenplay by ronald bass ; we\\'re given four interesting , vivid , and likeable characters , with some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments . \\nmy best friend\\'s wedding marks a strong career rebound for julia roberts , who turns in a top-notch , confident and reassured performance as julianne . \\nthis isn\\'t the sort of role one usually associates with ms . roberts - the julianne character\\'s neurotic , fumbling characteristics are more in line with a meg ryan role - but ms . roberts works wonderfully in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here , remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience , if not entirely sympathetic , even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable . \\neven better than ms . roberts though is cameron diaz , who turns in a shining performance in my best friend\\'s weddding . \\nwith a smile which lights up the screen , she effectively conveys kimmy\\'s insecurity and utter sweetness in an endearing manner , and never hits a false note in the film . \\nshe even sings - i won\\'t soon forget her charming serenade of \" i just don\\'t know what to do with myself \" . \\nrupert everett is given a very juicy role as george , and he makes the most of it with a hilarious turn which makes his character perhaps the most vivid and most memorable in the film . \\nhis george is a bit of a devilish rogue , entirely affable , and mr . everett\\'s performance is a delight to watch ; he\\'s clearly having fun , and his joy is infectuous . \\ndermot mulroney is adequate in a thankless role - unlike the other characters in the film , he\\'s not given a lot to do , but there is a genuine onscreen chemistry between ms . roberts and mr . mulroney , and consequently the longstanding friendship between his michael character and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic . \\nwhen julia roberts\\' lustre began to fade , and she was usurped from her title as \" america\\'s sweetheart \" by sandra bullock , i thought it was a canny career move on her part to take supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins and everyone says i love you to raise her profile . \\nwhile that didn\\'t quite work out , it\\'s near-certain that her successful return to the genre which made her a big star back in 1990 , the romantic-comedy , will once again raise her ante in the hollywood game . \\nmy best friend\\'s wedding marks a return to form for ms . roberts , and cements p . j . hogan\\'s reputation as a skilled director of comedy . \\n',\n",

       "  b'like a good action film should , \" metro \" has action that keeps you involved . \\nsome action films have action sequences that are so conventional , our attention is detracted and diverted by other thoughts . \\n \" the ghost in the darkness , \" which opened a few months ago , is a film that s action was so bland and uninvolving , it not only invited my thoughts to divert me , it nearly put me asleep . \\nbut \" metro \" is one of the best action films in a while . \\nit is hip , sharp , nifty , and has nice little pieces of suspense and comedy . \\neddie murphy was in bad shape for a while . \\nand this invites me to mention last year s \" the nutty professor , \" which was his blessed revival back to the position at which he used to be . \\n \" metro \" happens to be a lot better than any film in the \" beverly hills cop \" series . \\nthat is because \" metro \" takes itself seriously , but doesn t prevent itself from having a little fun . \\neddie murphy is at his best in the roles of responsible , and controlled people . \\nthe \" beverly hills cop \" movies all featured eddie as a reckless , wild cop , always crossing the line by just an inch . \\nin \" metro \" he plays a hostage negotiator , so negotiation is his job , not his hobby or his preferred way out of trouble . \\nhis character in \" metro \" takes himself seriously . \\neddie murphy s mischievous trademark grin is hardly anywhere to be found in \" metro , \" and perhaps it is quite better off that way . \\nmurphy plays scott roper , and as i previously mentioned , he is a san francisco hostage negotiator . \\nin the first tense situation in the film , we are introduced to roper s kind of work , as he tries to calm down a confused , unkempt young criminal who has taken captive the entire capacity of the san francisco bank he is holding up . \\nmurphy handles the scene seriously , without his usual happy-go-lucky , misfit humor . \\nthe film develops when its villain is established , and the villain here is the beguiling michael korda , a jewel thief , and murderer who likes to let cops know of his hostage fatalities by giving them the ear of the victim . \\n \" metro \" takes different twists and slight turns , and there is one great , virtuoso chase scene , involving the a cable car . \\ncars flip . \\ncars crash . \\ncars turn over . \\nand it is done so good in this film , i was reminded of \" speed , \" and the speeding bus that couldn t go under fifty mile per hour for very significant reasons . \\nthere are also some other good scenes in \" metro \" that a lot of films would rather choose not to have . \\nscenes like the one with roper and his new partner are at the horse track roper is a gambler who knows all the tricks and roper teaches his partner a few little methods of betting and winning . \\nof course , the writers tried to disguise the scene as being insignificant by having roper draw parallels between hostage negotiation and gambling . \\nthe scenes between roper and his girlfriend are nice , too . \\nthose are the scenes that make up \" metro , \" which is mainly about eddie murphy s maturing as a personality . \\nthe actor that i most enjoyed seeing in \" metro \" was michael rapaport , who plays roper s new partner , a lip-reading , book-skimming genius , and a master of observation . \\nit was not the actor s presence that pleased me as much as the role he was cast in the role of a proclaimed genius . \\nrapaport is an actor who i usually see in the role of the dimwit the really , really dopey dimwit . \\ni hardly recognized him in \" metro , \" and it was quite a joy to be able to see him in a role like this i feel that i respect him more . \\nthere are two main types of villains in movies like this : the ones that are part of the story , and the ones that are devices . \\nthe villain in \" metro \" is no more than a device , but he is a darn good villain nonetheless . \\nhe is played by michael wincott , whose voice is pushed out in a abraded rasp , as if he smokes a cigarette between every take . \\nwincott makes his villain , korda , as mean as could be , the classic type of villain who would push an old lady down a flight of stairs just for kicks , like richard widmark in \" kiss of death . \" \\nand , in addition , wincott s physical appearance and mannerisms , in the film , actually reminded my of an arrogant friend i use to have , who is no longer on my good list . \\ni liked \" metro , \" and i do not think would have worked with any other actor but eddie murphy . \\nhis past roles were the great ones but they were also a precursor to the maturing that would later take place , possibly from murphy s growing as a person , now having a family . \\n \" metro \" is a no-nonsense movie . \\nit works as a buddy movie , which it does not overplay . \\nit works as a dry comedy , which it does not overplay . \\nit works as a suspense film , which it does not overplay . \\nand it works as an action film , where it does have a tendency to occasionally go all-out . \\nbut who cares ? \\nit still remains serious , and it does not overdo itself . \\noh , and there were plenty of explosions in \" metro , \" as well . \\nhow nice it was of the filmmakers to give us those . \\nif there is one major objection i had to \" metro \" , it was the length , an area where a lot of action films seem to wear out their welcomes . \\n \" metro \" is a film that lasted a little too long , but it was still entertaining , and it gave me something to do while i waited for it to end . \\npaul haynes \" > \\n',\n",
       "  b'when people are talking about good old times , they actually want to make some bad times look better . \\nnice example of such behaviour is contemporary attitude of popular media towards the 1970s . \\nfor new generations , superseventies are the lost golden age of chic fashion , cult tv shows and sexual freedom unchecked by aids . \\nfor people who actually had to live in that period , it was the gloomy decade , marked by lost ideals of 1968 , rampant inflation and unemployment , international terrorism , fuel crisis and loss of faith in almost anything that previous generation stood for . \\nfeelings of despair and nihilism found its reflections in many films of that era . \\nmartin scorsese\\'s taxi driver , which symbolises both the glory and despair of the seventies , is most celebrated of them all . \\nthe movie\\'s protagonist is travis bickle ( robert de niro ) , 26-year old former marine who takes the job of taxi driver in new york city because he can\\'t sleep at nights . \\nthe job gets him exposed to the dark side of apocalyptic megalopolis , and travis gradually gets alienated from the rest of world . \\nthe only bright spot in his life is betsy ( cybil sheperd ) , attractive woman working in senator palantine\\'s presidential campaign . \\ntheir date ends as humiliating fiasco because travis makes fatal mistake by inviting her to porno movie theatre . \\nlosing his only link to better side of the world , travis gradually descends into psychosis , becoming convinced that his mission in life is to battle scum on the street . \\nhe purchases a formidable arsenal of guns and begins physical preparations for the inevitable conflict . \\nthat conflict finally comes when he takes personal interest in iris ( jodie foster ) , 12-year old prostitute who temporarily took refuge in his taxi . \\nas many great movies that got cult status through the years , taxi driver became the object of many interpretations . \\nfor some critics and scholars it is an exploration of universal subjects that date back to dostoyevski - loss of moral compass in a bleak reality of dirty , overpopulated industrial cities ; the story could have been set in 19th century same as in our times . \\nfor others , the movie uses raskolnikov-like figure in order to portray burning problems of 1970s america - its apparent inability to deal with the consequences of rapid social changes that occurred in previous decade . \\nbrilliant performance of robert de niro in role of a lifetime can give arguments for both sides . \\nhis travis bickle has a lot in common with most of the average viewers of today - many of us share his feelings of isolation , loneliness and outrage towards crime , drugs , prostitution and senseless street violence . \\nhis pathetic attempts to establish some kind of human connection with the people around him , sometimes in most unusual circumstances - like with secret service agents , pimps or job interviewers - make him a person too goofy to be the hero , and too pathetic to be the classic villain . \\nhowever , most of the average viewers are sensible enough to recognise the tin line that separate concerned citizens or troubled souls from fanatical madmen . \\nbut despite anything , average viewer at the end actually cheers for travis - his crusade against \" scum \" is something that average person wants , but doesn\\'t have a stomach/lack of brains to do it . \\nwhile de niro\\'s travis might come in and out of particular times and places , other persons that appear in the film ( mostly played by the character actors ) give it distinctively 1970s feel . \\nwizzard ( played by peter boyle ) presents the only link with america\\'s better past ; but only because he is the oldest taxi driver in company and therefore everybody assumes that he \" knows stuff \" . \\nhis obvious inadequacy in giving advice to troubled travis illustrates the inability of pre-1960s generations to find answers to the problems of gloomy decade . \\nother characters , on the other hand , show the bad side of new age . \\nmatthew \" sport \" ( keitel , who befriended real-life pimps in other to prepare for his role of a lifetime ) is dressed like a hippie ; iris found excuse for her escape to the world of drugs and child prostitution in a ideology of counterculture . \\nporno movies , that should be the element of new times of sexual freedom , are too much even for supposedly \" liberated \" betsy . \\neven the politicians , like senator palantine , are lost in post-vietnam and post-watergate mess ; his broad and senseless \" messages \" that cover the lack of any serious program can\\'t fool even such idiots like travis . \\nthe past is gone , the present is bad , and even the future seems bleak , and the feeling of pessimism can\\'t be washed away even by ironic happy end . \\ntravis and his world found themselves in a desperate situation , and martin scorsese uses the best of his cinematic skills in order to spill the gloom of schrader\\'s screenplay into the silver screen . \\nnew york city in the night is portrayed as a hell on earth , and the red light and steam coming out of sewers give it surreal , almost stygian atmosphere . \\nanother important element of the atmosphere is score of great bernard herrman , whose efficient use of jazz elements gives some melancholy that softens the brutality of motion picture . \\none of the greatest ironies of taxi driver is the fact that the movie was , same as his protagonist , famous for the wrong reason . \\ninstead of receiving cult status because of his artistic merits , for many years it was tabloid-fodder because of hinckley and his real-life re-enactment of events in the movie . \\nnow , more than two decades later , when some other \" life imitating art \" incidents get more attention , we can finally enjoy taxi driver in all its artistic glory . \\n',\n",
       "  b\"once again , the battle is dreamworks versus disney : earlier this year , the mammoth companies fought to the death with their end-of-the-world asteroid flicks , deep impact and armageddon . \\nhere we are now , just a few months later , and they're at it again with dueling bug movies , antz and a bug's life . \\nwhat i find so astonishing is that both pairs of movies are so inherently similar in both story and execution . \\ni mean , come on -- what were the chances of two studios both deciding to bring out computer-animated films about bugs ? \\nas was the case with the meteor movies , disney has come out on top : though antz is a likable movie , a bug's life is far superior . \\nin fact , this movie made me realize what was wrong with antz : i became immersed in the world of a bug's life , while antz just made me scrutinize everything . \\nbut it's not really fair to base an entire review on a comparison . \\na bug's life is a remarkable film in its own right , and deserves to be seen apart from any other computer-animated film about bugs . \\nin fact , it's one of the best films this year : it's smart , subtle , and funny , but it's also perfect family entertainment and relentlessly entertaining . \\ni haven't had such a good time at the movies in months . \\nit tells the story of an ant named flick ( voice by dave foley ) ; he's a nice guy , but he's also a troublemaker . \\nthe ants spend all season putting together the offering , a big pile of food that they provide for the grasshoppers . \\njust before the grasshoppers come , flick accidentally knocks over the offering , and ruins everything for the entire colony : the grasshopper's leader , hopper ( kevin spacey ) , is enraged , and tells them that the ants need twice the food by the end of summer , or they're all dead . \\nflick , feeling responsible for this , sets off to look for help -- he realizes that the only way to be rid of the grasshoppers is to fight them . \\nhe heads to the city ( the city being a house a few miles away ) , where he finds a colorful bunch of circus bugs : a ladybug ( denis leary , who is spectacular ) , a black widow ( bonnie hunt ) , a caterpillar ( joe ranft ) , a butterfly ( madeline kahn ) , a rhinoceros beetle ( michael mcshane ) , and a stick ( david hyde-pierce , also giving a hilarious performance ) . \\nflick doesn't know they're actors , and they don't know that flick needs them to kill a bunch of grasshoppers , so they return to the colony with flick and find themselves in an unusual position . \\nthe most obvious element of a bug's life is the quality of animation . \\ncreated by pixar , the same people who brought us toy story , a bug's life has some of the most amazing visuals i've ever seen . \\nthe bugs seem to inhabit a three-dimensional space , and occasionally there will be a shot that is indistinguishable from live action . \\nthis is a lush , colorful world , full of life and imagination : the way the animators insert the things all of us see in our daily lives ( matches , bottlecaps , tin cans , etc . ) and make them active objects in the bugs' world is innovative . \\nthe film is also mercilessly exciting , particularly in a superbly-staged scene involving our heroes' escape from a bird ( a little bird never seemed so huge and threatening ) . \\nbut the makers of a bug's life know where the importance lies : story and characters . \\nflick , with solid voice work from foley , is a great guy to lead the story . \\nbut the real treat comes with the circus bugs ; they're such a likable group of characters -- the standouts are the stick ( hyde-pierce is so good ) , francis the ladybug , and the big fat caterpillar . \\nall of these bugs have more than a token personality , which makes the suspenseful scenes work because we care about the bugs , and it also keeps the tear-jerking scenes from seeming obligatory . \\nin my review of antz , i said that the film is a clever cop-out because it presents a bunch of little humans reacting to an ant-like existence . \\nin concept , a bug's life is basically the same movie , except that i was never given enough time to find things that i didn't like about it . \\nwith such strong work in both animation and script , a bug's life is nothing but a joy to sit through . \\nit really is too bad that it had to come out so close to that other bug movie , but a bug's life is so good that i'm sure it will find its audience . \\nafter a slew of endlessly violent and cynical movies , it's downright refreshing to sit through an innocent picture like this and laugh without feeling guilty . \\n\",\n",
       "  b\"my giant begins with a monologue that's more funny than not and a distinctive `princess bride , ' medieval fairy-tale-in-the- ? 90s feel . \\ni was pleasantly surprised how sharp the comedy was , with very funny scenes occurring on a movie set in romania where talent agent sammy ( billy crystal ) is visiting a client and in the monastery where sammy ends up after being mysteriously saved when he accidentally plunges his car into a stream . \\nand when sammy meets max , his giant , mysterious savior played by gheorghe muresan , there is magic in the air ; albeit it a bit goofy , i loved every minute of it . \\nthe film , of course , plays on the size difference between the two , and at times you would almost swear it must be special effects . \\ni particularly enjoyed a shot of sammy dangling his legs from a max-sized chair as the two face each over an enormous table and eat from oversized bowls and spoons . \\ni also liked jere burns' ( from tv's `something so right' ) performance as the director of the film in romania . \\nat this point , the primary flaw in the film is that gheorghe muresan is incredibly hard to understand , particularly during his fast-paced first scene . \\nit is unfortunate that the script required him to speak quickly right out of the gate , as i did understand him more as the film continued and i became accustomed to his speech . \\nhowever , about the time muresan becomes coherent , the characters head to new york and the film takes a dive . \\noff the high board . \\nsuddenly , we are expected to believe sammy is a do-whatever-it-takes slime ball . \\nup until this point he was pursuing his own interests to be sure , but he didn't come off as a desperate jerk . \\nif he had , the first scenes could never have been so lighthearted and magical . \\nbut now , in new york , we are further introduced to his neglected wife and son , and his character is desperate enough to involve max in a disturbing giant vs . midgets wrestling match , which i found quite unpleasant and jarring within the framework of the film . \\nindeed , many scenes stuck out of this film like incorrectly placed puzzle pieces . \\nthis includes the scenes featuring steven seagal , when sammy gets max a role in a big , hollywood movie filming in las vegas . \\nwhile i enjoyed seeing seagal poke fun at himself , the scenes appeared to exist solely because of his participation , rather than because the film demanded it . \\nand the audience is required to take a huge leap to believe that max would win the role based on his quotations of shakespeare . \\nat this point i found myself thinking , `we're supposed to believe that someone would cast this guy in a film ? ' \\nthen i realized he was , and i was watching it . \\nin the final third , the film undergoes another transformation , this time to unbridled sentimentality . \\nnote : major plot points are revealed in this and the final paragraph . \\nmax went to america because sammy promised to reunited him with his childhood love , lillianna , who hasn't seen him since he was a normal-sized kid . \\nher refusal to see max ( unbeknownst to him ) leads us to an awkward `ends justify the means' scene as sammy's wife serena , played nicely by kathleen quinlan , poses as lillianna . \\ni found this scene offensive . \\nnot only did it rely on deception to induce warm , fuzzy feelings from the audience , it reduced max to someone we should pity and coddle , which i thought was quite undeserved . \\ni think max could have handled the truth , gratuitous illness and all . \\nlate in the film we learn max , and in fact all giants , have a heart condition which shortens their lives considerably . \\nthis could be an enlightening revelation , but the film seemingly presents it only to justify sammy's transformation into a caring , sensitive guy -- and hey , a great dad and husband , too ! \\n`my giant' suffers from a poorly constructed story line and undeveloped characters whose actions are determined by plot points rather than their own internal persuasions . \\na stronger story with more room for character growth might have been possible if the focus was on max's struggle to be accepted and cast in movies instead of sammy's struggles to get money and become a better person . \\nin this scenario , max's illness could have been a integral part of the film not a story motivator . \\nsentiment and emotion would have followed naturally . \\ninstead , we're apparently not supposed to like sammy until the end , but we're not allowed to focus on max . \\ncrystal and muresan give adequate and at times enjoyable performances , but in the end , `my giant' left me feeling like i'd been fed gruel from a giant spoon . \\n\",\n",
       "  b'in the wake of the smashing success of \" rumble in the bronx , \" it\\'s looking more and more likely that more jackie chan films will see american release . \\nrumor has it that one of these films will be drunken master ii . \\nthe version i have is a copy from the laserdisc ; it\\'s widescreen and bilingually-subtitled , as are most hong kong films these days . \\navailability over here in the united states is very limited ; these films must either be purchased via pirates or sought out from asian distributors such as tai seng . \\nthe subtitling on the copy i have is slightly hard to read ; the letters are white and a bit small . \\nalthough the american release will almost certainly be dubbed , this review is of the subtitled version , so please keep that in mind if you\\'re reading this review to help you decide whether to go out and see it . \\nto be fair , i must admit that i\\'ve never been very fond of \" period-piece \" martial arts movies--the ones set in some nebulous china of the distant or not so distant past . \\nperhaps it\\'s because most of those i\\'ve seen were filmed on inferior stock , with either butchered dubbing or all-but-illegible subtitling , or perhaps it\\'s because their plots all tend to be very similar to each other and , in many cases , all but nonexistant . \\nin fact , many of them get so wrapped up in their subplots that they seem to forget their main plot entirely until only a few minutes before the end . \\nor , for that matter , it might be because the jackie chan films with more modern settings ( armour of god , rumble in the bronx , etc . ) tend to have more spectacular stunts , often involving large motor vehicles and large explosions , whereas period pieces simply have the martial arts . \\nhaving said that , i must now turn right around and say that drunken master ii is a remarkable exception to all or most of the above , is one of the better martial arts films i\\'ve seen , and i quite enjoyed it . \\nsurprised ? \\nwell , so was i . \\ndrunken master ii is about a young man named wong fei-hong ( played by jackie chan ) who is a master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu . \\nwhere he learned this style is uncertain , as his father , wong kei-ying ( ti lung ) is steadfast in his opposition to fei-hong\\'s practicing it rather than some more normal style of kung fu . \\napparently , fei-hong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore , rather like paul bunyan is for americans , but i\\'ve heard very little about this , and could quite well be wrong , so i\\'ll leave analysis of that to the people who know it better . \\none of my friends points out that the character of wong fei-hong is also featured in the \" once upon a time in china \" movies , but i have not yet seen those . \\nthe plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy , as are the plots to many such films , but if you\\'re watching a jackie chan film , odds are you aren\\'t expecting something on the order of \" war and peace \" . \\nthe story seems to revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics ( and hence , china\\'s cultural heritage ) while overworking , underpaying , and beating up chinese workers in a nearby steel mill . \\nhowever , this plot merely serves as a framework for the other main story of the film--fei-hong\\'s perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend , supplicate his father , keep his ( pregnant ) mother ( played by anita mui ) from fighting , and keep from getting beaten up by evil foreigner thugs . \\nthe macguffin that drives the plot ( s ) is a precious antique jade imperial seal which is being taken away by the evil foreigners . \\nin the beginning , fei-hong accidentally steals it while trying to recover an identically-wrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing back for a customer . \\nin the process , he clashes with another thief , who is himself trying for the seal but ends up instead with the ginseng . \\nafter fei-hong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the evil foreigners\\' lackies , thanks to some timely intervention by a general\\'s son ( a cameo appearance by andy lau , who would later take on the starring role in drunken master iii ! ) , comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when fei-hong and his mother attempt to come up with a replacement for the missing ginseng . \\nand so it goes . \\nand the plot thickens later on , such as when fei-hong\\'s girlfriend maneuvers him into a kung fu match with a rival , or when fei-hong and the thief , now revealed to be a loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners , are attacked en masse ( another grand kung-fu movie tradition ) , but i think i\\'ve already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves . \\nlet\\'s move on to the real draw of jackie chan movies . . . the \\naction . \\nthere\\'s plenty of martial arts action to be found in this movie . . . of \\ncourse , in a kung fu film , that\\'s to be expected . \\nhowever , this isn\\'t just another kung fu movie ; this one has jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography , and jackie chan is a genius . \\nthe primary martial arts \" style \" featured in the film is drunken boxing , a form of kung fu which attempts to draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk . \\nfurther , for the purposes of this film at least , drunken boxers fight better when they actually _are_ intoxicated . . . but \\nthere\\'s a fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into a stupor . \\nunder normal circumstances , the idea of someone staggering around looking sloshed but managing to fight effectively and even incredibly might seem rather stupid , but jackie pulls it off with flair . \\nthe kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless to try to describe it on paper , so i\\'ll just say that the fights--especially the big climactic fight at the end--in themselves make the movie worth watching . \\nanother thing drunken master ii has going for it is the stunt work . \\neven without motor vehicles ( well , not counting a train ) , there are some remarkable stunts in this film . \\namong other things , jackie dives off a balcony into a table and crawls across hot coals ( not once , but at _least_ twice , if you count the outtake shown during the credits ) . \\n ( quicktime movies of these stunts can be found through the www movie database . ) \\nunlike in american films , these stunts are _not_ faked . \\ndrunken master ii stars several veteran actors of the hong kong movie scene , including jackie , ti lung ( \" a better tomorrow \" 1 & 2 ) , and anita mui ( the \" heroic trio \" series , \" rumble in the bronx \" ) . \\nthe performances are first-rate , especially when it comes to the comedy parts of the film . \\nthe scene where fei-hong and his mother conspire literally behind fei-hong\\'s father\\'s back to cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious , as is the scene where fei-hong\\'s mother , having just revealed that she is pregnant , is threatening to hurt herself ( in order to draw her husband\\'s anger away from fei-hong ) . \\njackie has developed his knack for physical comedy into a sort of mastery over the years , and he\\'s in fine form all through drunken master ii . \\nas far as cinematography is concerned , it certainly works for this film . \\nit\\'s nothing spectacular , but is at least a dozen times better than all those old kung fu movies of the 70s . \\nthe picture is crisp and clear . \\none thing i find particularly worthy of mention is that , at least in the copy i have , the screen was wider than any film i\\'ve ever seen on videotape before--almost a whole 1/3 of the screen was blocked out above and below . \\n ( watch this on a bigscreen tv or movie theater if you can . ) \\nit will be an utter shame if this film is eventually pan-and-scanned for american video release . \\ndrunken master ii shows the full potential of \" period piece \" kung fu movies , and it\\'s good enough to overcome even my usual distaste for such movies . \\nthe plot does meander a bit , but that\\'s to be expected in this type of film . \\nif you like this kind of movie , you\\'ll love this movie , and if not , well , give it a chance anyway . \\nif nothing else , the martial arts and stunt sequences are by themselves worth the price of admission or rental . \\n',\n",
       "  b'if you\\'re the kind of person who goes to see movies just because you long for some of that overpriced theatre popcorn ( butter optional ) , then this is the movie for you ! \\nindeed , this has got to be either one of the most unimaginative rip-offs of other recent action movies , or an incredibly unfunny spoof of them . \\nit\\'s difficult to fathom such insipidness unless you actually watch this film . \\nbut at least we\\'re warned very quickly that we may regret our ticket purchase , giving us an opportunity to sneak on out and into the adjacent show . \\nwhat are the four ingredients of a really bad action movie ? \\nfirst , the movie gives us an introductory premise . \\nhuge caverns exist deep beneath the ocean floor , and in this area , many ships have disappeared . \\noooh . . . scary ! \\nsecondly , a cheesy soundtrack tries to connote a tone of mystery , but only succeeds in drowning our ears with an abrasive musical score . \\nthird , the main character is a mercenary that delivers goods without asking about the contents of his cargo ( treat williams ) . \\nhe operates a sophisticated military-style pt boat and every word that comes out of his mouth is awash in comical flippancy . \\nfinally , in the cargo hold , we see those that hired him . \\nthey are also mercenaries that have tough-looking haircuts , talk with accents , and try to show how macho they are . \\nduring their trip across the stormy sea , their boat suffers an incident and requires repairs . \\nspotting a cruise ship in the distance , they make their way to the ocean liner and devise a plan to raid the machine shop , take the parts that they need , and then continue on their merry way . \\nlittle do they know that this cruise ship has become infested by some kind of ocean monster . \\nyet , they board the ship armed to the hilt with grenades and machine guns that can kill dozens in a matter of seconds . \\nthis is nothing more than a by-the-book action film . \\ntheir realization of the situation that they\\'re in doesn\\'t happen until they are in the bowels of the boat . \\nthose who are dumb enough to stray off on their own will ultimately get killed . \\nthe corridors on the ship are narrow , misty , and provide the kind of atmosphere that all scare-fests must have . \\nyet , despite the predictable nature of this film , there are some scary \" boo \" moments . \\nbut most of it is just outright silly . \\nand this film is unusually gory too . \\nmonsters basically suck off the flesh and spit out skeletal remains . \\nthere is one particularly neat scene where a monster has been cut apart and reveals a victim that is still alive . \\nhe screams horribly as the monster\\'s digestive juices continue to slowly eat him away . \\nadditionally , it borrows heavily from speed2 , alien and a bunch of other recent films . \\nthe mercenaries even run into a lone , surviving passenger ( femke jannsen ) who looks amazingly like sandra bullock . \\nto be honest , when i left the theatre , i just had to laugh at how witless the film was . \\nit\\'s moronic fun at best . \\nso , if you\\'re hankering for a large bucket of popcorn served with a side of silliness , then this might just hit the spot . \\n',\n",
       "  b\"full metal jacket , very much like every other hard-hitting film about the vietnam war , is an shocking , emotional depiction of the war that effected almost everyone in america . \\nthis film is more like platoon than any other in the way that it chronicles the struggles of a young man ( private joker , played by matthew modine ) during his tour in the vietnam war . \\nhowever , full metal jacket gives the audience an insight into combat life very rarely seen before : boot camp . \\nthese sequences are considered to be the best part in this three act film , even though i found the later portions to be equally stunning . \\nas in platoon , full metal jacket gets off to a quick start . \\nthe opening sequence is the initiation for the recruits , which is getting their heads shaved . \\nfrom there , they find themselves standing at attention and receiving their orders from the extremely hard and punishing sergeant hartman , played extremely well by the former drill instructor r . lee ermey . \\napparently , the solution was found for the perfect man to play a drill instructor in the movies , because ermey depicts his character extremely well and will make you thank whomever that you were never subjected to such horrible situations . \\nprivate joker gets off on the wrong foot with the sergeant , as does the large bodied private leonard lawrence ( vincent d'onofrio ) , whom is dubbed 'gomer pyle' by sgt . \\nhartman . \\nthe film is continually narrated by private joker , in which he explains his visions on what is going on . \\nthe entire corps , although repeatedly hammered by sgt . \\nhartman , continues on . \\nprivate pyle , however , seems to be the rag doll for the drill instructor . \\nhe continually absorbs the worst punishment and humiliation , and it basically does not stop . \\nthat is , until sgt . \\nhartman comes up with a new plan . \\nhe will punish the rest of the soon-to-be-marines for pyle's goof-ups , even after joker was assigned to help him out in the best way he can . \\npyle then receives punishment from his fellow recruits , and things take a turn for the worst . \\npyle proves that not everyone is emotionally , physically , and mentally cut out for the life of a marine . \\nafter graduation , joker is sent over to the height of the action in order to document the war , which is his service . \\nhe is not a member of the infantry , and it is unclear if he will ever actually find himself in combat . \\nwhen he sets out on a documenting mission , this question becomes very clear from the start . \\njoker joins up with a platoon , along with his hometown friend cowboy ( arliss howard ) , and follows their everyday actions , interviewing and filmming them along the way . \\nhe also soon finds himself in a position in which he must fight , or die . \\nagain , as in the tradition of vietnam war films , full metal jacket can be debated as to whether it is an anti-war film or not . \\na few of the more powerful scenes toward the end will leave you to decide . \\nfull metal jacket succeeds extremely well in documenting the life of a young man in vietnam , as have others in the past . \\nthis film , in different ways , also can be viewed as more powerful than others . \\nthat , again , is up for debate and depends on your opinion . \\none thing is for sure , however ; no one ever wants to experience the absolute hell that these soldiers are subjected to . \\nunfortunately , many did . \\n\",\n",
       "  b'wolfgang petersen\\'s latest , the perfect storm , is like a pineapple . \\nit only tastes good after arduous peeling and digging - if you try to eat the fruit , spikes and all , it\\'s going to hurt ? quite a bit . \\nok , maybe that was a confusing analogy , so here\\'s my main complaint about the latest man battles nature flick : there isn\\'t really much of a story to tell . \\nbasically , a massachusetts fishing crew goes out to sea on a small boat , called the andrea gail , and gets stuck in the middle of \" the storm of the century . \" \\nhow much time does it take for petersen to tell this story ? \\nnot nearly enough . \\nso he spends the majority of the film developing pointless side stories which all eventually become superfluous . \\naudiences want to see the storm , they want to see a fight for survival but what they get is a lot of cliched , maudlin drivel . \\nthe last quarter of the perfect storm is utterly perfect in every aspect , but just try lasting the first three-quarters . \\ni have yet to read sebastian junger\\'s the perfect storm , but from what i have heard it is an unforgettable tale . \\nbased on a true story , the book must have found some other way to introduce the characters because in the movie version , the approach is weak . \\nusing a wonderfully patriotic score by james horner , petersen almost hides the in-your-face banality . \\nright away the central characters are introduced : the gritty , determined captain ( george clooney ) , the ingenue ( mark wahlberg ) torn between his job and his girlfriend ( diane lane ) , the loving father ( john c . reilly ) , the comic relief who\\'s always trying to get laid ( john hawkes ) , the new guy ( william fichtner ) who immediately antagonizes a crewmate and the quiet , french guy ( allen payne ) . \\nso many problems strike the opening segment of the film that the remaining portions directly suffer . \\nit is not the all-star cast\\'s fault , just the characters designed for their portrayal . \\nallen payne\\'s character never speaks in the entire movie , not because he is mute , but because he\\'s never given any lines ! \\nare we supposed to root for a guy whose face and voice we are never given a chance to interact with ? \\nfichtner\\'s character is terribly underdeveloped - we don\\'t know what he\\'s doing there , where he\\'s from , or who he\\'s supposed to be . \\nthe remaining four fishermen are all cardboard stereotypes ( hawkes says to a female stranger in one scene \" you know what would look good on you ? \\nme ! \" \\nooooh real creative ) . \\nas the script advances and the andrea gail floats farther out into the waters , the crew continues to not feel human . \\nonly when the storm takes center stage does the movie jump out of its sleepwalk . \\nthe computer-generated images of gigantic waves crashing against a helpless boat are thunderously real . \\ni can only imagine if this was an imax film , this city kid would surely never go in the water again . \\nthis is loud , jolting entertainment - adjectives that completely negate the rest of the film . \\nthe perfect storm was unfortunately a disappointment . \\nthe maelstrom lived up to its potential but everything else failed to do so . \\ni guess i\\'ll stick to that other survival spectacle ? you know the one on cbs ? \\n',\n",

       "  b'i\\'m not quite sure how best to go about writing this review . \\ni must admit that i was a little disappointed by barry levinson\\'s political satire \" wag the dog , \" but in retrospect , this has less to do with the film itself than with false expectations i had going into it . \\nquite a few of the reviews i have read led me to believe that this film was absolutely hilarious and would make me laugh out loud the whole way through , and it didn\\'t do that . \\nthey also led me to believe that it would deliver a vicious and all-too-true attack on the way the american political media works , and it didn\\'t quite do that either . \\na few of them even suggested that it would prove a worthy successor to stanley kubrick\\'s \" dr . \\nstrangelove \" in the tradition of political black comedy , and it most definitely didn\\'t do that . \\nthat said , \" wag the dog \" is actually a very clever satire on the shady manipulations of political figures and those who assist them . \\nthe story revolves around the attempts of political spin doctor conread brean ( robert deniro ) to distract the american public from the accusations that the president , who is up for re-election in two weeks , sexually harassed a young girl in the oval office . \\nthe accusations , the script suggests , are probably untrue , but as brean so pointedly puts it , that isn\\'t particularly relevant : the scandal is likely to derail the president\\'s campaign regardless of its truth or falsehood . \\nbrean , along with his assistant ( anne heche ) , decide to contact hollywood producer stanley motss ( dustin hoffman ) to enlist his help in concocting enough propaganda and special-effects trickery to make it appear that the u . s . is going to war with albanian terrorists and thus propel the president to victory on a wave of patriotic fervor . \\nas i said , \" wag the dog \" is not quite as laugh-out-loud hilarious as i had expected , but there are some genuinely funny moments to be found here , such as when , in an echo of a familiar movie clich ? , the camera pans out over an urban sunset to the strains of uplifting , inspirational music , then cuts to a studio to reveal that the singing is coming from a group of musicians whom motss has assembled to perform \" we have the right to fight for democracy . \" \\nanother scene shows us how , with modern editing equipment , an actress running across a sound stage with a bag of potato chips can be turned into a frightened young girl and her kitten fleeing a terrorist attack on her village . \\nthe most consistently effective gag revolves around the propaganda team\\'s attempt to forge a fictional war hero out of sgt . \\nwilliam \" old shoe \" schumann ( woody harrelson ) , an ex-military officer who turns out to be a first-class psycho . \\nof course , not everything goes as planned ; the cia , for example , realizes what\\'s going on and strikes a deal with the president\\'s electoral opponent to report to the media that the \" fighting \" has ended , forcing motss and brean to come up with a new angle on the supposed albanian crisis . \\nstill , even with the cia\\'s involvement , the film falls a little short in terms of making this scenario believable . \\nregardless of the official word from the president or the cia , wouldn\\'t the major media outlets have eastern european correspondents who could verify that there is , in fact , no fighting going on in albania ? \\nthe film never addresses this question , nor does it show the reactions of the american public to the news of the apparent war except for a few scenes which border on the farcical , such as when basketball fans litter the court with shoes in support of the aforementioned sgt . \\nschumann ; we are apparently meant to assume that everyone is buying it . \\nthere was also an instance , towards the end of the film , in which one of motss\\'s forced reinventions of the story seems to contradict what he and brean had been selling to the public thus far and could conceivably have given the game away . \\nwith these plot holes , \" wag the dog \" doesn\\'t quite work as a satire of american politics , but it does send up the mentality that might lead to these kinds of machinations in the first place . \\nbrean and his advisors never seem concerned that what they are doing is unethical ; rather , they worry about how convincing it will be and whether or not they have enough money to pull it off . \\nthe film takes a decidely dark turn towards the end , as we learn how far they are willing to go in order to keep the propaganda campaign a secret . \\nmotss and his hollywood buddies , meanwhile , seem completely out of touch with the rest of the world and just see this undertaking as another creative project . \\nin fact , one of the sources of conflict in the film is motss\\'s increasing restlessness with the idea of not being able to take credit for producing the fake war ; in his mind , it is the greatest work of art he has ever created . \\ni think it\\'s fair to say that \" wag the dog \" underachieves a little bit : more attention to the public reaction and tighter plotting might have made this into a four-star film and a classic satire . \\nstill , the issue of an american president using war and patriotism to distract from scandals or domestic unpopularity is a very real one . \\nwag the dog takes the issue one step further and asks , what if the war wasn\\'t even real ? \\nwith this premise and the talented cast , the film still delivers more consistently than most , whatever its flaws . \\n',\n",

       "  b'in chocolat , a chocolate shop owner tells her customers to look into a spinning object of obscure textures , patterns , and lines , hoping she\\'ll be able to foresee the kind of chocolate they\\'ll most enjoy . \\nsome scoff the idea , but everyone who gazes into the complexity of the spinning object winds up seeing something different than the next , revealing personality traits which the person may not have known they had before . \\nthis can easily stand as a model for chocolat as a whole : on the surface , it appears to be a light , fluffy fable with no depth or true worth , but when one takes a second , deeper look , chocolat\\'s true colors begin to shine through . \\nmaking a bold statement about organized religion and those who practice it , lasse hallstrom\\'s chocolat is flawlessly acted and meticulously crafted-not to mention one of the best films of the year . \\nwhat gives chocolat its magic , much like hallstrom\\'s 1999 winner of two academy awards , the cider house rules , is its willingness to say what\\'s on its mind without holding back to prevent offending audiences . \\nthe bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage a select group of viewers , but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film says about narrow-mindedness . \\nchocolat centers its story around the small french village of lansquenet , where majority rules , and the majority lives by only one law : religion . \\nthe bulk of the townspeople ( with few exceptions ) are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence , lent , but when the independent thinking , seemingly non-religious vianne rocher ( juliette binoche ) and her daughter anouk ( victoire thivisol ) make the village their home , the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouth-watering confections in the chocolate shop vianne opens . \\nmany are predictably opposed and deeply offended by vianne\\'s opening of the chocolate shop just in time for lent , especially the mayor , comte de reynaud ( a cartoon-like alfred molina ) , who will stop at nothing to put her out of business . \\non the other hand , the shop is a delight to others , including the cranky armande voizin ( judi dench ) , who sits day by day in vianne\\'s shop , telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached relationship with her grandson ( aurelien parent-koening ) , which comes as a result of his mother ( carrie-ann moss ) believing armande is a bad influence , as she does not hold the same , strict religious beliefs that she does . \\nalso a fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat , whose husband is constantly beating her , to whom vianne offers a home and befriends . \\njuliette binoche is charming and honest as vianne , genuinely capturing her character\\'s determination to turn the narrow-minded townspeople into more happy , independent human beings , but most of chocolat\\'s success is unquestionably a result of the remarkable performances of the supporting actresses . \\nlena olin , previously nominated for an oscar in 1989 , deserves her second nomination for her earnest , moving portrayal of a lost , scared woman torn between staying true to her battering , manipulative husband or leaving him to live the life which for which she longs . \\njudi dench is sharp , incisive , and occasionally greatly touching as armande voizin . \\ncarrie ann-moss , in what is likely to be her first largely noticed ( and acclaimed ) role since the matrix , shows a more solid side of her acting skills not previously seen , crafting a character that the viewer both sympathizes with and despises simultaneously . \\nvictoire thivisol shows much promise as anouk , a young girl hoping her always-on-the-move mother will eventually settle down . \\na trade ad for chocolat sums up best the power the actresses have on screen with the tagline : \" five extraordinary women , one extraordinary movie . \" \\nthat\\'s not to say the men don\\'t do their share , though : alfred molina makes for a sly and utterly repugnant antagonist , hugh o\\'conor adds quite a bit of comic relief as the priest who seems to not even know why he is who he is , and johnny depp gives a strong performance as the pirate roux , who enters the film late in the game and sparks the romantic interest of vianne . \\nthe technical aspects of chocolat are strong across the board : lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care , perfectly balancing the elements of each genre to be found within the film . \\ncinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric , fairy tale look to the film , and rachel portman\\'s masterful score is her best and most memorable since the cider house rules . \\nchocolat , adapted by robert nelson jacobs from the joanne harris novel , is a wonderful little treat of a film , one that will most likely win over the hearts of audiences and the votes of academy members this winter , and the aggressive backing of miramax films assures the latter . \\nwhile not as powerful as the cider house rules , lasse hallstrom\\'s chocolat is a film which works on all levels-as a drama , a comedy , a fable , a romance , and a fairy tale . \\nand it even lives up to its

       "  b'blatantly borrowing elements from 1993\\'s \" like water for chocolate \" and 1991\\'s \" the butcher\\'s wife , \" \" simply irresistible \" attempts to be a whimsical romantic comedy but , more often than not , comes off as laughable , leaving you to wonder why rising star sarah michelle gellar ( t . v . \\'s \" buffy , the vampire slayer \" ) would choose such an obviously inept film project to waste her time on . \\nthings get off to a bad start right from the onset as amanda ( sarah michelle gellar ) , a young woman who runs her late family\\'s struggling new york restaurant , runs into a mystery man who forces a bushel of crabs on her and then vansihes into thin air . \\nwhile out shopping , she also meets tom ( sean patrick flanery ) , a charming , handsome man , who happens to be planning a ritzy restaurant for the department store he works for , and later when he decides to drop by her dive , called southern cross , for lunch , she somehow makes a delicious crab dish for him , even though she is known to not be a very good chef . \\nsuddenly , amanda finds her restaurant , on the edge of foreclosure , rejuvenate to life as customer begin to swarm for her food , which strangely causes everyone immediate jubilation when it hits their mouths . \\nare amanda and tom destined to be together ? \\nand is it not just because of the magical food , but because they really , truly like each other ? \\nand what exactly is going on with the food she is making ? \\ndoes it have anything to do with that pesky crab she got that sits on the shelf in the kitchen somehow assisting her in her food preparation ? \\n \" simply irresistible \" is a ridiculous and just plain goofy romantic fantasy that\\'s as flimsy as a slice of bologna . \\nit takes one joke---that people who eat the food are taken aback by it in most unusual ways---and recycles it over and over again until the film has reached an appropriate running time of 95 minutes . \\nadd in a music montage every ten minutes ( these are actually the best scenes in the movie , which certainly tells you something about the film itself ) , and what you\\'ve got is an utterly empty , if not necessarily boring , excursion . \\nthe cast of \" simply irresistible \" is fairly good , but it is the supporting characters who are the most interesting . \\npatricia clarkson ( 1998\\'s \" high art , \" in which she played a drugged-out lesbian ) is a standout as tom\\'s colleague , and is thankfully given a few funny lines of dialogue . \\nalso of note is larry gilliard jr . , as amanda\\'s cooking assistant and buddy , who is allowed to create a seemingly full character out of only a handful of scenes . \\nof the main stars , sarah michelle gellar is fine , but really does often look like she\\'s struggling through the unmistakably clumsy material , and if sean patrick flanery plans on keeping a film career in the future , he has certainly got to pick better projects than this . \\nthe bottom line is that \" simply irresistible \" is the exact opposite of its deprophesized title , and when the movie got to the point where the characters began to float in mid-air ( an unamusing plot device that was repeated in the stupid last scene ) , my mind checked out from the characters and the romance . \\nwhen i think about it in hindsight , i should have checked out in the very first scene , where the point of the action was for gellar to crawl under tables looking for a runaway mechanical crab . \\nnow , that certainly is what i\\'d call magical ! \\n',\n",
       "  b'the first species was a moderately-successful science fiction yarn that diverted audiences with some nifty special effects , a few well- paced action sequences , and frequent views of model-turned-actress natasha henstridge sans clothing . \\nhowever , it was definitely not a movie that cried out for a sequel . \\nand , considering the quality of species 2 , it\\'s obvious that mgm should have stopped while they were ahead . \\nthe only thing that distinguishes species 2 is how awful it is . \\nif you throw away the plot , which is characterized by a blatant disregard for intelligence , logic , coherence , and consistency , species 2 actually has a few things to recommend it to a select audience . \\nof course , that audience is primarily comprised of teenage boys ( who , at least in theory , shouldn\\'t be able to get into an \" r \" -rated film ) and connoisseurs of bad movies . \\nthere\\'s enough blood , gore , simulated sex , and bare flesh in species 2 to prevent it from ever becoming boring . \\nthis is a grade z exploitation flick that\\'s ripe for the mystery science theater 3000 treatment . \\nsomewhere , someplace , i recall hearing species 2 described as \" erotic . \" \\ni would love to know who used with that adjective for this movie , because he ( or she ) has a peculiar notion of eroticism . \\nsure , there\\'s a lot of sex and nudity , but it\\'s almost always accompanied by the ripping open of a woman\\'s abdomen as an alien baby claws its way free , splattering blood and gore in all directions . \\nanyone turned on by that is not someone i would care to be sitting next to in a theater . \\ni suppose the main attraction in species 2 is natasha henstridge ( and , to get the obvious question out of the way -- yes , she does remove her top , but only once , and only briefly ) . \\nalthough the character she played in the original species is dead , government scientists still have the dna , and , out of what can only be described as a suicidal impulse , they decide to create another clone . \\nthis creature , dubbed \" eve \" by its creator , dr . laura baker ( played by marg helgenberger , reprising her role ) , is genetically engineered to be kinder and more docile . \\nmeanwhile , man has finally set foot on mars . \\na team of three , led by patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , has traveled to the red planet , but when they return to earth , they bring something with them . \\nross has become a half-human/half-alien hybrid , and he\\'s soon mating like crazy , collecting the blood-soaked children that are the result of each sex session . \\nhis intention is obviously world domination . \\nstanding in his way is that indomitable soldier of fortune from the first film , preston lennox ( michael madsen ) , and one of patrick\\'s fellow astronauts , dennis gamble ( mykelti williamson ) . \\nbut when patrick learns about eve , a female of his kind , there\\'s no damping his ardor . \\ni\\'m not sure what the budget for species 2 was , but a significant portion of it must have gone into paying handsome salaries to several recognizable actors ( as opposed to being diverted into the special effects ) . \\nmichael madsen and marg helgenberger , both back for a second round , are clearly on hand to do as little as they can , grab the money , and run . \\nditto for james cromwell , who plays patrick\\'s father -- \" underused \" is too kind a word to describe his involvement ( \" invisible \" would be more like it ) . \\ngeorge dzundza gets to do a little scenery- chewing as an angry-but-inept general . \\nmeanwhile , justin lazard\\'s performance as patrick is so flat that he makes natasha henstridge\\'s limited abilities look good by comparison . \\nthe only one in the whole production with any energy is mykelti williamson , who is cast in the part of the wisecracking black sidekick . \\ncomplete with cheesy special effects , bare breasts around every narrative corner , and dialogue capable of producing howls of laughter , species 2 has been dumped into the marketplace without advance screenings for critics . \\ndirector peter medak , a journeyman film maker with a significant list of mediocre movies on his resume , has added another forgettable title , but at least he appears to have had fun doing it , which is more than can be said of anyone trying to take this film with even a scintilla of seriousness . \\ndo i recommend the movie ? \\nabsolutely not , but i will admit that species 2 is dopey enough that it didn\\'t try my patience to the degree that some pseudo-intellectual bad movies do . \\nhere\\'s hoping there\\'s no species 3 . \\n',\n",
       "  b\"it is with some sad irony that i screened fright night part 2 on the day that one of it's stars , roddy mcdowall passed away at the age of 70 . \\nmcdowall was one of the most talented and prolific actors in hollywood , having a career that spanned over 60 years and appearing in more than 100 films . \\nfright night part 2 probably will not be counted among his more memorable roles . \\nthis is really sad considering how good the first fright night film was . \\nwilliam ragsdale and roddy mcdowall both reprised their roles as the somewhat reluctant vampire killers who seem to be the only ones that realize that vampires walk among us . \\n ( at least in the movies anyway . ) \\nit has been several years since charlie brewster ( ragsdale ) and b-movie actor turned late night horror film host , peter vincent ( mcdowall ) came face to face with a real live vampire who just happened to be charlie's next door neighbor . \\ncharlie and peter won that battle , but apparently even vampires have relatives who get pissed if you kill members of their family . \\napparently charlie's former bloodsucking next door neighbor had a sister who was none too pleased to find out that some kid and an aging actor staked her sibling . \\nso she decides to exact a little bit of revenge . \\nthis ends up forcing charlie and peter to battle the forces of darkness yet again . \\none of the things that made fright night such a success was chris sarandon who played charlie's stylish next door neighbor with a taste for blood . \\nfright night part 2 tries to duplicate that modern style but it falls sort . \\nwhile they are stylish , the vamps in this film just don't have the personality of the undead in the first film . \\nwith the exception of a werewolf who adds some much needed comic relief to a few of the scenes . \\none bright spot , speaking from a strictly sexist point of view , is traci lin , who plays charlie's very skeptical girlfriend . \\nit's really a shame that her career hasn't been better since she made this film . \\nragsdale does a fair job in this film , but doesn't give nearly the performance that he did in the original . \\nroddy mcdowall makes the most with what he is given , which unfortunately isn't much which is a shame because his character was a lot of fun in the original movie . \\ni guess i would have to say that the first film was a superior product in every way . \\nthe original always left you feeling danger was lurking right around the corner , part 2 had more of the feel of a music video . \\nnever a good thing for a horror film . \\nanother minus for part 2 was the traditional scenes that leave the audience on the edge of their seats waiting for something to jump out of a shadow where very rare . \\nfor that matter , they were almost nonexistent . \\nif i was going to watch a horror film , this would be far from my first choice . \\nthe first fright night , on the other hand , would be right up near the top of my list . \\nif i was in the mood for a roddy mcdowall film i'd probably head to the science fiction section of my local video store and rent planet of the apes . \\neither way fright night part 2 would most likely not enter into the equation . \\n\",\n",
       "  b' \" what is this , a homicide or a bad b-movie ? \" \\nthat is the prophetic question asked by one of the leads in one of the early scenes of this movie . \\nlet me clear things up for you cupcake , this isn\\'t a bad b-movie , it\\'s a really bad b-movie . \\nso bad , it\\'s almost good . \\nalmost , but not quite . \\nthe movie starts off in the 1950\\'s with space aliens sending a botched experiment down to earth . \\nit is a bunch of slug-like creatures that kill people and take over their bodies . \\nthe slugs\\' first and only victim in the fifties is cryogenically frozen where he is of no danger to anybody . \\nthat is , until two loser university students unfreeze him in 1986 . \\nhe , and the slugs inside him , promptly begin wreaking havoc and turning more co-eds into slug zombies . \\na slightly crazed cop ( tom atkins ) and the requisite girl with the face of an angel ( jill whitlow ) join these two geeky university students ( jason lively and steve marshall ) to do battle with the slugs . \\nit more or less falls on the four of them to make the world safe again from the evil slugs . \\nthe acting is bad with a capital b . the story is worse . \\nand the special effects are somewhere between an old rerun of star trek and what you see in a home movie . \\nthe only saving grace was the requisite tit-shot courtesy of jill whitlow . \\nit had absolutely nothing to do with the story -- but i liked it . \\nactually , it was the high point of the movie for me . \\nof course , that isn\\'t really saying much . \\nthe story moves around in a hap hazard fashion . \\nwhich gives it a leg up on some other horror films . \\nunlike most movies of this genre , there actually is a story . \\nnot a great one , but it is there . \\nthis is one in a long line of movies from the 1980\\'s that were thrown together to capitalize off the success of the friday the 13th , halloween and nightmare on elm street movies . \\nyou could randomly select a movie out of the horror section of you local video store and probably luck into something just as good if not better . \\nbut night of the creeps might make a nice addition to a b-movie horror marathon . \\njust don\\'t be too upset if you can\\'t find it . \\nyou really won\\'t be missing that much . \\n',\n",
       "  b'martin scorsese\\'s films used to intimidate me . \\nbecause of his reputation , i felt obligated to appreciate them as deep film art rather than as great flicks . \\nas much as i enjoyed them , i usually felt like i missed something . \\ni learned from scorsese\\'s casino that whatever techniques he uses are merely there to enhance the story . \\nno mystical interpretation is required to appreciate his movies . \\nfor example , in casino he uses subtitles when robert deniro and joe pesci are using code words with each other . \\nthere was no meaning more exotic than that subtitles were the most succinct way for him to tell the audience what was really going on . \\nor toward the end , when he uses three quick dissolves to compress a scene of a car backing away from a building . \\nagain , the simple , mundane explanation is that it helped the pacing . \\ni don\\'t mean to say that his techniques are not creative or good-looking . \\nbut he simply uses the best tool for the job . \\nit shouldn\\'t have surprised me , then , that kundun , a film about a mystical religion , actually turned out to be quite straightforward . \\nthe movie follows the life of the 14th dalai lama , the spiritual and political leader of tibet . \\nthe movie\\'s title is another name for the dalai lama which means \" ocean of wisdom . \" \\nhis story is told in strict chronological order and there are only a few cinematic visions to embellish the literal story . \\n ( one of which makes an interesting statement : pay attention to the film\\'s opening shot and watch where it is repeated . ) \\nwe first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two years old . \\nhis curiosity and self-assuredness capture the attention of a monk wandering in search of the new lama . \\na test is arranged to see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the 13 dalai lamas who have gone before . \\nseveral items belonging to the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other items . \\nthe child is asked if he recognizes any of the items as his own . \\nthe boy picks correctly , proving that he is the new , and the old , dalai lama . \\nscorsese and long-time editor thelma schoonmaker were kind enough to allow the possibility that the child was taking his cues from the monk . \\nbefore selecting an item , he would look at the monk , perhaps for some sort of confirmation . \\nsometimes he picked right the first time , and sometimes he made a second choice . \\neither way , whether through reincarnation or quick human perception , the tibetans were assured of choosing a boy who could be a wise , perceptive leader . \\n>from this point on , the boy is raised as the reincarnation of the lama\\'s spirit and the future leader of a nation . \\nit is a great weight to put on the mind of a child . \\nin the u . s . it might be grounds for a call to social services . \\nbut the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage . \\nneither the great power nor the awesome responsibility keeps him from becoming a genuinely likeable , well-rounded person . \\ncertain patterns take shape over the years . \\nfor example , the dalai lama is fascinated by technology . \\nradios , clocks , and telescopes are some of his favorite toys . \\nwhen he is old enough to accept his leadership , he makes plans to modernize isolated tibet . \\nhe also has a soft spot for creatures who are suffering or in pain , including herd animals . \\nit\\'s nearly a running gag that he will buy sheep to keep them from being herded to slaughter . \\nbut the most ominous constant throughout his life is the presence and threat of tibet\\'s gigantic neighbor , china . \\ntibet and its leaders prove correct in fearing china , as , first the propaganda , then the political pressure , and finally the armies , come across their common border . \\nthe chinese invasion is so successful that the lama\\'s life is in danger if he stays . \\nthe movie ends when , after much agonizing , the dalai lama leaves tibet for india . \\nthe story doesn\\'t lead up to a cinematic climax as strongly as most feature films do . \\nit just doesn\\'t fit that mold . \\nif it were forced into such a shape it would have been a completely different movie ( perhaps more like seven years in tibet , which is good in its own right ) . \\nthe pacing of kundun is more calm and level than that . \\nthe structure of the film is made to fit the characters and events , not vice-versa . \\nperhaps because the pace is slower , we have more time to notice the beautiful art , vestments , and architecture of tibet . \\na mandala , ( tibetan sand painting ) with beautiful , vibrant colors is shown throughout the movie . \\nthe robes and hats of state are bright red and gold . \\nthe bricks are a rich reddish brown , not unlike the skin tone of the tibetans . \\neven the touchstone pictures logo before the movie ( which is usually light blue ) is the red and gold of tibet . \\nphilip glass composed the music for kundun , and he was the perfect choice . \\nfor those who don\\'t know of glass , his music is like a tibetan mandala . \\nhis building blocks are lots of small notes , tiny grains of music , which are first grouped , then repeated in patterns . \\nthese patterns create interesting textures which are themselves part of a larger composition . \\npeople won\\'t be flocking to kundun for it\\'s great ending , or talking about its outstanding plot , but it does have a lot to offer : an interesting lifetime , exotic sights , rich cinematography , and innovative music . \\nit gives interesting insight into tibetan buddhism and takes a warm look at the dalai lama as a person . \\non top of it all is the cinematic mastery of martin scorsese , who gives the film a strong , beautiful , consistent look . \\n',\n",

       "  b'up until about a year ago , john travolta\\'s career consisted of those \" look who\\'s talking \" movies ( notice how they never called them look who\\'s talented ) and the 1991 bomb shout ( which was bad enough to make most people scream ) . \\nbut somewhere along the line , travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction and his career soared once again . \\nweird how someone whose career was on par with the bee gees back in 1978 would experience fame and fortune once again , while barry , robin and maurice gibb could do no better than a 1993 straight-to-the-cutout-bin album aptly named \" size isn\\'t everything \" ( and of course , they learned that sales are everything ) . \\nbut now travolta\\'s back on the hollywood scene once again , and i think we all know why . \\nfour words : contract with the devil . \\nand this has nothing to do with newt gingrich\\'s \" contract with america . \" \\nno , satan is much more humane . \\nanyway , yes , travolta has sold his soul to the hairy host of the netherworld . \\nhow do i know ? \\ni own the document in question . \\namazing what you can buy at those collector\\'s shops for a few hundred dollars , isn\\'t it ? \\nget shorty continues in the vein of pulp fiction , with travolta as crime minion chili palmer . \\nhe goes to collect some of the mafia\\'s money from a b-grade director ( gene hackman ) and suddenly finds out he wants out of the mob game and into the movie game . \\nsure , a ruthless criminal like him is far too honest to make it in hollywood , but i guess that\\'s beside the point . \\npalmer is determined to get hackman\\'s next project made , so he sets out to convince big star martin weir ( danny devito ) to star in the movie , bringing along down-and-out horror actress karen flores ( rene russo ) , who has already had affairs with hackman and devito . \\nit doesn\\'t take a las vegas odds-maker to predict that she and travolta will soon be hitting the sheets as well , after the customary sexual tension and denial , which has been used in every comedy from \" who\\'s the boss ? \" \\nto speechless . \\nit works in this case , unlike \" who\\'s the boss ? \" \\nalthough it\\'s interesting to note that tony danza has signed a contract with the devil also . \\ncomplicating matters somewhat are the mobsters who have backed hackman\\'s other films and want in on this one too , along with travolta\\'s mob boss trying to track him down for defecting . \\nget shorty is by no means on the same level as pulp fiction , despite the obvious similarities . \\nthis movie doesn\\'t have near the amount of originality or depth as pulp fiction but it is definitely one of the most entertaining movies i\\'ve seen this year ( yes , even better than halloween vi ) . \\nget shorty is my kind of movie , one that mixes intelligent humor with action and violence . \\ni\\'m definitely going to have to check out the novel it was based on . \\nare you getting this , shorty ? \\n',\n",

       "  b'okay , bear with me y\\'all , cause first off i have to get this off my chest : \\nwhat the hell is up with that damn crab ? ? ? \\nwhew . okay . \\ncause that same clip shown over and over again was beginning to get on my nerves towards the end , as cute as the crab maybe . \\neven i know that you need more footage than * that * . \\nand that wasn\\'t the only thing getting on my nerves . \\nthe cutesy gimmicks , saccharine sweet score / soundtrack and the pretty young faces of sarah michelle gellar ( as amanda ) and sean patrick flannery ( as tom ) might have held some appeal during , oh , say the first 10 minutes of the movie . \\nat first the movie moves along at a quick , interesting pace . \\nit is speedily established that something magical is about to happen to amanda when she encounters a totally random fairy godfather type person on the street , whose aforementioned crab follows her everywhere and just * doesn\\'t * die . \\na ridiculous concept , yes , but at this point i\\'m willing to accept it because i\\'m willing to accept that this is how amanda\\'s life is changed , how her powers are received . \\nlater on , the movie can\\'t seem to decide whether these powers come from this fairy godfather or from amanda falling in with tom . \\nand this is why the clips of the crab were annoying ; they weren\\'t just repetitive , they were out of place and unnecessary . \\nthe plot stumbles along at an uneven speed , sometimes dwelling too long on a particular development ( amanda suddenly becoming a great chef , her falling in love with tom , etc . ) , sometimes moving on too quickly for its own good . \\nsome places the plot just doesn\\'t make sense , sometimes it\\'s way too contrived ( the crab bit , for example ) , and sometimes too corny ( peaches emitting dry ice . \\ncan\\'t beat that ) . \\nall in all the plot seemed fragmented , unconnected . \\nnot romantic at all , and only funny in some places . \\nso , okay , do the magic powers come from the crab ? \\nor the fairy godfather ? \\nshe can * float * now too ? \\nand all of a sudden , instead of just making dry ice come out of peaches , she can put her emotions into her food ? \\ntom all of a sudden just accepts amanda\\'s \" witchcraft \" in the end ? \\nwould people really dine in a restaurant that resembles life after death in tupac\\'s video ? \\nwhat the hell is up with that damn crab ? \\nit is unfortunate , because i liked the basic premise of the movie , until it became too fantastical and tiresome . \\nthe film seemed to skirt around a serious theme or at least * a * theme for a while , but towards the end it resolved to show us long flashback clips and 5 minutes of people crying at their tables . \\nthe humor was good in some places ( nolan gets the funniest bits , including that incomprehensible , totally random thing with the dolls ) . \\ngellar and flannery are qualified actors , and gellar has a particular charm , but i much prefer her playing the saucy buffy ( or even annette in the upcoming \" cruel intentions \" ) than this sorry excuse for a character . \\nit\\'s almost funny sometimes to see these two trying so hard to make the dialogue sound better than it is , or trying to make the relationship seem more plausible . \\nthe supporting character nolan was a highlight , though he reminded me a bit of kevin in \" you\\'ve got mail \" ( see footnotes ) . \\nand , as always , typical of a chick flick / romantic comedy , there\\'s a seemingly endless romantic soundtrack in the background , cued up at all the right places . \\nthis sort of got on the nerves after a while , too . \\n \" simply irresistible \" is not hard to understand , light , funny in some places , and generally disappointing because it can\\'t draw the line between romance and protracted sap , between humor and tired slapstick . \\nand how could i refrain from making a pun ? \\n . \\n . \\n . \\n \" simply irresistible \" is all too easy to resist . \\n ( first viewing , 2/6/99 ) \\n * did anyone else think this was a tad bit similar to \" you\\'ve got mail \" ( or \" the shop around the corner \" ) ? \\nbusiness rivals fall in love . \\nfemale counterpart\\'s business is in danger of being shut down . \\nfemale as mother- like figure guiding her . \\nthe annoying , hysterical ex-girlfriends . \\n * i _really_ like sarah michelle gellar\\'s wardrobe . \\n',\n",
       "  b'those print and television ads trumpeting that \" \\'grease\\' is still the word \" are right on the money . \\nto celebrate its 20th anniversary , this quintessential movie musical is getting the royal treatment reserved for classics like \" star wars \" -- a well-deserved , red-carpet rerelease . \\nthat\\'s fantastic , especially when considering of all the classic characters and scenes the film has served up -- who can forget aspiring beautician frenchie ( didi conn ) being serenaded by her tell-it-like-it-is guardian angel ( frankie avalon ) ? \\nor the hard-nosed principal ( eve arden ) reminding the student body to \" be an athletic supporter \" by rooting for the home team ? \\nor national bandstand emcee vince fontaine ( edd byrnes ) flirting with marty ( a pre- \" empty nest \" dinah manhoff ) ? \\nand these are all probably considered minor moments . . . \\na very skinny john travolta and a very young olivia newton-john have the respective leads of danny zuko and sandy olsson , and their pairing still ranks as one of screendom\\'s most effervescently charming . \\nfor those eight of you who aren\\'t familiar with the story , here\\'s a brief recap : greaser bad boy danny and aussie good girl sandy are reunited for their 1959 senior year at rydell high after a brief fling during the summer ; both thought she was going to return to her native continent before school started , but both were wrong . \\nsandy tries to rekindle their relationship , but danny\\'s too cool a cat to fall for her wholesome appeal in front of his t-bird buddies ( including jeff conaway ) . \\nso sandy hooks up with a gang herself -- the pink ladies , headed by sassy , sexy rizzo ( stockard channing , just superb as an independent woman well ahead of her time ) -- and danny , who still really feels love for her , attempts a compromise of ideals in order to win her back . \\nthe drag race finale is yet something of a drag , and i never have thought much of \" greased lightening , \" the film\\'s big \" guy \" number ( that choreography -- ack ! ) , but \" grease \" \\'s flaws amount too few to carp . \\nthe movie\\'s first showpiece is \" summer nights , \" where danny and sandy separately recount wildly different versions of their fun-in-the-sun romance . \\nnot only is \" nights \" tremendously catchy , but it\\'s also a smart look at how men and women see the same events with varying eyes . \\nthere has yet to be a live-action musical sequence that rivals the one-two punch of \" you\\'re the one that i want \" and \" we go together , \" \" grease \" \\'s euphoric cappers . \\nall this and some of the most pleasing moments come from the smaller , quieter moments ; the oscar-nominated \" hopelessly devoted to you \" is a lovely showcase for newton-john , and channing\\'s lamenting ballad \" there are worse things i could do \" is one of \" grease \" \\'s most unjustly overlooked tunes . \\nthe soundtrack is remastered ( though travolta still hits that awful high note at the end of \" nights \" ) and the restored widescreen allows us to see previously pan-and-scanned-out choreography , but nothing else has changed -- no computer-generated backgrounds , no outtakes or new musical numbers , no jabba the hutt cameos . \\nand it\\'s a testament to \" grease \" \\'s timeless success that nothing needs to be changed -- it\\'s the same all-around blast it\\'s always been , with an appealing cast in a fun story told with great music . \\nto \\'90s viewers , \" grease \" will probably recall disco and bellbottoms as much as it made its original audience nostalgic for doo-wop and poodle skirts . \\nbut regardless of what decade it transports us to , we can all agree on one thing -- without a doubt , \" grease \" is still the word . \\n',\n",

       "  b'titanic is , without a doubt , the best movie i\\'ve seen all year . \\nand believe me , i\\'m not an easy critic to impress : the english patient was too long , men in black was over-hyped , and several of the \" big summer releases \" were dead in the water . \\nthank god this film got delayed until december . \\nit\\'s my christmas present . \\ntitanic is in the tradition of the old hollywood epics of years-gone-by , and it is truly a stunning film . \\nwhile watching this picture you are completely mesmerized , never taking your eyes off the screen , nor checking your watch to see how much longer it\\'s gonna last , despite its 3 hour plus running time . \\nas a friend of mine , who\\'s a true titanic-buff , said \" if someone doesn\\'t like this film , it\\'s because they didn\\'t want to . \" \\ntruer words are hard to come by . \\nof course , it doesn\\'t hurt that this film comes from one of my favorite directors , james cameron , who is unarguably the greatest action director of all time . \\nif you wish to argue that point with me , look at his list of credits : the terminator , aliens , the abyss , terminator 2 , true lies , etc . still care to disagree ? \\nnot only has cameron helmed the directorial duties of this film , he also wrote , produced , and edited it . \\nand to show his true faith for the project , he renenged all directing fees and percentage points to ease the budget costs . \\nit\\'s obvious he truly loves titanic . \\nthe film opens with footage , both real and fake , of an underwater excursion by special submarines to the bottom of the atlantic , where a team of explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing for a diamond called the \" heart of the ocean \" , which , according to bill paxton\\'s character , would be worth more than the hope diamond today . \\ntheir search turns up , dissapointly , no diamond , but instead a drawing of a young woman wearing the diamond . \\nthis picture is broadcast on cnn and is seen by a 101 year old woman named rose , who claims to be the girl in the picture . \\nshe is flown out to sea to meet bill paxton and to tell them about the diamond . \\nalmost all of the rest of the movie is her narration of the past . \\nrose\\'s narration shows us how she was an unhappy young girl , engaged to a rich man named cal hockley ( billy zane ) that she didn\\'t want to marry . \\nher mother is pushy and obnoxious , and cal hockley is arrogant . \\nthey are boarding the titanic , which is sailing to america , and this is where she is to marry cal . \\nmeanwhile , a young man named jack dawson ( leonardo dicaprio ) and his italian friend ( danny nucci ) win two 3rd class tickets aboard the titanic in a poker game . \\nthey are overjoyed , and rush aboard just as the boat is leaving . \\nfor them , this is their ticket to america , to a better life . \\nfor rose , she is sailing to her doom . \\nthe first hour and a half or so of titanic tells the story of how rose dewitt ( kate winslet ) and jack dawson fall in love . \\nit\\'s the classic wrong-side-of-the-tracks story , and does sometimes resort to a few cliches . \\nbut as i said above , the love portion isn\\'t sappy and doesn\\'t \" weigh the film down \" , as some critics have said . \\nit\\'s sweet , and it didn\\'t make me restless at all , despite the fact that i usually hate love stories . \\nof course , it might help that cameron introduces some pretty interesting characters to help keep our eyes glued to the screen . \\nmost of these people actually were passengers on the titanic back in 1912 , including the enigmatic molly brown ( played by the talented kathy bates ) , the captain of titanic ( bernard hill ) , and so on . \\nall of these characters add an extra depth to the film , and make it that easier to watch . \\nof course , things really start to get going after the hour and a half mark , where the titanic strikes the iceberg and begins a slow sink to the bottom . \\nthe sinking is depicted realisticly , and the effects are truly amazing . \\nit is not told in a heroic fashion sense either , as people are portrayed as panicking , pushing others aside to get on the limited lifeboats , and drowning and dying horrible deaths . \\nthe best part of the movie , in my opinion , comes at the very end , when we flash back to the future . \\nthe crew , who at first had been skeptical of rose\\'s story , now are totally aborbed by her . \\nrose goes out onto the ship\\'s ledge , and we then learn a secret about her that catches us off guard . \\nwe then see a dream of rose\\'s , in which she returns to the titanic and is dancing with jack dawson . \\nmost people i talked with after the movie saw this as only a dream . \\nhowever , i think it symbolized more ; i think it meant that rose had died , and is going to a sort of heaven , which would be the happiest part of her life : her and her one true love , jack . \\nif anyone has seen the movie and would like to voice an opinion about this , e-mail me at venom8@hotmail . com . \\n',\n",

       "  b'since most movies about slavery shield us from the true horrors of what they\\'re portraying , it\\'s fitting to say that \" beloved \" come as a real shock as a film . \\nit\\'s confusing , bizarre , and as tough a film to watch as any film i\\'ve seen all year , and that\\'s not necessarily because of the three-hour running time . \\n \" beloved \" is challenging to watch , filled with tough and powerful poetry that takes us completely off guard , and instead of a straight-forward , hollywood-ized story about what happened to the slaves after they were freed , \" beloved \" comes off as a cry of anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened ( or , rather , toni morrison , who wrote the novel upon which this is based ) . \\n \" beloved \" tells the story of an ex-slave named sethe , played by oprah winfrey , who lives on a large farm in the north with her children . \\nwhen the film opens , her house is being terrorized by a poltergeist , which shakes things up , wounds the dog , and makes things generally uncomfortable for the family . \\nsethe is proud , though , and will not move . \\nher sons run away , leaving only her and her daughter , denver ( kimberly elise ) alone with the ghost which is there without any factual explanation . \\na couple years pass , and the ghost remains , and one day , a man named paul d ( danny glover ) , another ex-slave who knew sethe years ago when they worked on a plantation together , arrives , asking for lodging . \\nhe has been wandering around since he left the plantation , and when he enters the house , it turns red and becomes incredibly hot . \\nwhen he remarks about what he thinks is evil , sethe replies \" it ain\\'t evil . \\nit\\'s just sad . \" \\nsome more time passes , and paul d has become a fervent member of the household , and the ghost disappears . \\nbut when they return one day from going out , they discover a young woman sitting in the house . \\nher name is beloved , and as played by thandie newton , she has almost zero motor skills . \\nshe stumbles around , half-grabbing onto things and knocking them over , and when she speaks , she lets out a low guttural sound that eventually turns into baby talk . \\nthey let her into her house , and she begins to turn things upside down . \\n \" beloved \" acts like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with a ghost story . \\nmost of the scenes consist of people arguing in one claustrophobic , low-lit room , with the occasional flash to the past , where we see images of such horror that we thank god for modern-day psychoanalysts . \\nsethe and paul d have lived through such hellish times that they are forever implanted with the memories of their slavehood on the old plantation , which includes such images as sethe being raped by the white plantation hands , with her nipples being licked , prompting her to cry out to paul d when reminiscing about it , \" they took my milk ! \" \\nworst of all was the month after her freedom , when she was allowed to live like a free person , working with other blacks on a farm , and then seeing that her old plantation owners have arrived to presumedly take her and her children back . \\nshe runs to the barn near by , carrying her four children , and when her old owners burst in , they discover she has murdered one of them and is ready to murder the rest of them if they don\\'t leave them alone . \\nwhen she is inquired about this moment by paul d in a moment halfway through the film , she says she doesn\\'t regret it . \\nshe killed her daughter so that she would not have to live through the horror she did , and she has convinced herself she did the right thing . \\nof course , beloved is really her daugher materialized , though we aren\\'t flat out told that until later on in the film . \\nbeloved represents the pain and suffering the slaves went through and shows how difficult it was for them to deal with their freedom after being tortured for so long . \\nthus , \" beloved \" becomes a sorta-redux of the andrei tarkofsky sci-fi classic , \" solaris , \" where a cosmonaut discovers that his wife , who commited suicide years before , has materialized when he is orbiting over a planet with a complex brain system . \\nthat film spoke volumes about humanity and our memories , how we are constantly regretting what happened in the past , and when if it ever literally came back to haunt us , it would control us completely . \\n \" beloved \" moves along freely , without a lot of explanation , and for the most part , this is extremely respectable . \\nthe most interesting films are the ones that don\\'t explain everything for us , leaving gaps in the characters that we are supposed to fill in with how they act in the present tense . \\nsethe is never fully explained as a character , but we understand all her actions since she\\'s being played by oprah winfrey . \\nit\\'s been well over a decade since her last major performance in \" the color purple , \" but judging from these two films , i\\'ll bet she\\'s one of the best actresses working today . . . if \\nshe was strictly an actress . \\nher talk show , which i suppose is a great entity , has prevented her from becoming a noteworthy actress , and that\\'s a shame because she brings so much to this movie . \\nemotion . \\nsadness . \\nstrength . \\nwatching the strong sethe , who\\'s so afraid of the past that she\\'s built a rather strong protective coating around herself , break down when she discovers who beloved really is is what makes this movie really great . \\nshe makes it real . \\nthat\\'s not to say this is a perfect film . \\nin fact , i\\'d wager to say that the fact that it\\'s confusing and painful to watch is what prevents this from being the truly great film it is . \\nwhile oprah\\'s performance is powerful and easily sympathetic ( and i\\'m dying to see her win at least an oscar nomination this february ) , the structure of the film , which doesn\\'t show what happened to her children till halfway through the film , prevents us from really making a cohesive connection to the film . \\nit doesn\\'t necessarily move as though they\\'re memories of one particular character , and by the end , it has lost control over sethe , and as she takes to bed , we are unable to truly identify with her anymore . \\nbut despite its tediousness , perhaps that\\'s the point . \\nthe distancing by the end of the film may be just part of the way it has been built from the start , since they figure she has crossed over from being identifiable , and it needs to get back with reality . \\nand for the most part , this film seems like the cry of pain from the slaves that it really wants to be . \\njonathan demme\\'s direction is bizarre , in nature with the story , and he creates the right mood , making it a tough film to sit through , making sure that the audience feels as uncomfortable as the characters . \\nthere\\'s more to admire here , like the way that the flashbacks pop up freely and without real organization , just like they would be in real life ; and the way that the ending leaves it somewhat open to more pain and suffering , but laced with a touch of optimism . \\nthe acting , not only from winfrey , is amazing , and i anticipate not only she will get an oscar nomination . \\neveryone has been raving about thandie newton\\'s performance , and how it should be rewarded . \\nhowever , it must be noted that out of everyone , she had the easiest part . \\nact like a baby . \\nthrow things . \\nstumble around . \\nchew food with your mouth open . \\ni do think there\\'s another performance worthy of oscar conisderation , but it\\'s kimberly elise , as the daugher who has to stay sensible and sane , and has to carry the burden of her mother\\'s loss of reality towards the end . \\nit\\'s not that newton isn\\'t great : she\\'s as annoying and wacky as the role demands . \\nit\\'s just that elise has the tougher job and pulls it off even better . \\ndespite the fact that this film has winfrey written all over it , and not that of writer morrison or director demme , \" beloved \" has still not done well . \\ncosting , i think , around ninety million dollars , it has since grossed about twenty-two . \\nunfortunately , this film is a little too intense for viewers , even for me , and i can stand almost anything ( i recently viewed the 2 1/2 hour long epic \" caligula , \" the worst film i have ever seen in my life , and did it in a mere 2 sittings ) . \\nalthough i respect \" beloved , \" i can\\'t say that i really enjoyed it . \\n',\n",

       "  b'weighed down by tired plot lines and spielberg\\'s reliance on formulas , _saving private ryan_ is a mediocre film which nods in the direction of realism before descending into an abyss of cliches . \\nthere ought to be a law against steven spielberg making movies about truly serious topics . \\nspielberg\\'s greatest strength as a director is the polished , formulaic way in which every aspect of the film falls carefully into place to make a perfect story . \\nbut for a topic of such weight as combat in the second world war ( or the holocaust ) this technique backfires , for it creates coherent , comprehensible and redemptive narratives out of events whose size , complexity and evil are utterly beyond the reach of human ken . \\nin this way spielberg trivializes the awesome evil of the stories he films . \\n_saving private ryan_ tells the story of eight men who have been detailed on a \" pr mission \" to pull a young man , ryan ( whose three other brothers were just killed in fighting elsewhere ) out of combat on the normandy front just after d-day . \\nryan is a paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines the night before the landings and became separated from his fellow soldiers . \\nthe search for him takes the eight soldiers across the hellish terrain of world war ii combat in france . \\nthere\\'s no denying spielberg came within shouting distance of making a great war movie . \\nthe equipment , uniforms and weapons are superbly done . \\nthe opening sequence , in which captain miller ( tom hanks ) leads his men onto omaha beach , is quite possibly the closest anyone has come to actually capturing the unendurably savage intensity of modern infantry combat . \\nanother pleasing aspect of the film is spielberg\\'s brave depiction of scenes largely unknown to american audiences , such as the shooting of prisoners by allied soldiers , the banality of death in combat , the routine foul-ups in the execution of the war , and the cynicism of the troops . \\nthe technical side of the film is peerless , as always . \\nthe camera work is magnificent , the pacing perfect , the sets convincing , the directing without flaw . \\nhanks will no doubt be nominated for an oscar for his performance , which was utterly convincing , and the supporting cast was excellent , though ted danson seems a mite out of place as a paratroop colonel . \\nyet the attempt at a realistic depiction of combat falls flat on its face because realism is not something which can be represented by single instances or events . \\nit has to thoroughly permeate the context at every level of the film , or the story fails to convince . \\nthroughout the movie spielberg repeatedly showed only single examples of the grotesque wounds produced by modern mechanized devices ( exception : men are shown burning to death with relative frequency ) . \\nfor example , we see only one man with guts spilled out on the ground . \\nhere and there men lose limbs ; in one scene miller is pulling a man to safety , there\\'s an explosion , and miller looks back to see he is only pulling half a man . \\nbut the rest of the corpses are remarkably intact . \\nthere are no shoes with only feet in them , no limbs scattered everywhere , no torsos without limbs , no charred corpses , and most importantly , all corpses have heads ( in fairness there are a smattering of wicked head wounds ) . \\nthe relentless dehumanization of the war , in which even corpses failed to retain any indentity , is soft-pedaled in the film . \\nultimately , _saving private ryan_ bows to both hollywood convention and the unwritten rules of wartime photography in its portrayal of wounds and death in war . \\nrather than saying _saving private ryan_ is \" realistic , \" it would be better to describe it as \" having realistic moments . \" \\nanother aspect of the \" hollywoodization \" of the war is the lack of realistic dialogue and in particular , the lack of swearing . \\nanyone familiar with the literature on the behavior of the men during the war , such as fussell\\'s superb _wartime : understanding and behavior in the second world war_ ( which has an extensive discussion on swearing ) , knows that the troops swore fluently and without letup . \\n \" who is this private ryan that we have to die for him ? \" \\nasks one infantrymen in the group of eight . \\nrendered in wartime demotic , that should have been expressed as \" who is this little pecker that we have to get our dicks shot off for him ? \" \\nor some variant thereof . \\nconversations should have been literally sprinkled with the \" f \" word , and largely about ( the search for ) food and sex . \\nthis is all the more inexplicable because the movie already had an \" r \" rating due to violence , so swearing could not possibly have been eliminated to make it a family film . \\nhowever , the most troubling aspect of the film is the spielbergization of the topic . \\nthe most intense hell humans have ever created for themselves is not emotionally wrenching enough for steven spielberg . \\nhe cannot just cede control to the material ; he has to be bigger than it . \\nas if afraid to let the viewer find their own ( perhaps unsettled and not entirely clear ) emotional foothold in the material , spielberg has to package it in hallmark moments to give the war a meaning and coherence it never had : the opening and closing scenes of ryan and his family in the war cemetary ( reminscent of the closing scene from _schindler\\'s list ) , the saccharine exchange between ryan and his wife at the close ( every bit as bad as schindler\\'s monologue about how his car , tiepin or ring could have saved another jew ) , quotes from abraham lincoln and emerson , captain miller\\'s last words to private ryan , and an unbelievable storyline in which a prisoner whom they free earlier in the movie comes back to kill the captain . \\nthat particular subplot is so hokey , so predictable , it nigh on ruins the film . \\nnowhere in the film is there a resolute depiction of the meaninglessness , stupidity and waste which characterized the experience of war to the men who actually fought in combat ( imagine if miller had been killed by friendly fire or collateral damage ) . \\nbecause of its failure to mine deeply into the terrible realities of world war ii , _saving private ryan_ can only pan for small truths in the shallows . \\n . \\n',\n",

       "  b'i have to admit that i disliked this film initially . \\nit certianly isn\\'t for every taste , and it\\'s sheer torture to sit through if you\\'re in a restless mood . \\nthat said , if you are in the right mood , it\\'s absolutely incredible . \\nthis was my second favorite movie of 1998 , and would have been a shoo-in for first in almost any other year . \\nperhaps the big turn-off for many was this film\\'s unconventionality . \\ni\\'d be hard-pressed to compare it to any other film that i\\'ve seen - it is very , very artsy , incredibly slow - and amazingly , it works beautifully . \\non my second viewing , i realized that the film follows the three act structure ( i didn\\'t think it had any sort of structure at all when i first saw it ) . \\nthe first act serves to set up the characters - sort of . \\nit exists even moreso to set a mood of tension and restlesness , and perhaps even feelings of boredom . \\nand then it is shattered by the intense violence of the second ( which encompasses most of the movie ) . \\nthe majority of the film is one extended battle scene , intercut with brief flashbacks and voice-overs . \\nthe artsier elements do not detract from the action , but add to it - they succeed in briefly letting the viewer peek into the minds of the soldiers , only to be suddenly yanked back into reality when the battle resumes . \\nthe battle scenes are amazing ( second only to \" saving private ryan \" in my opinion ) . \\nthey\\'re brutal , horrifying , and at times beautiful due to the amazing cinematography . \\nthe second act is as immersive , brilliant , and haunting as any film that i have ever seen . \\nthe only problems come during the first and third acts . \\nmalick takes a little too long to get the film started . \\nalthough the initial scenes - which consist of two soldiers\\' experiencing a near-eden-like paradise while going awol , and the preperations for battle - are effective and necessary , hints of pretentiousness sink in . \\nthe film is just a tad too artsy near the beginning , and a lot of people that disliked the movie probably gave up on it because of this . \\nthe final act is effective at winding the film down , but the problems from the first persist - it\\'s a bit too long , and comes over as pretentious at times . \\nthat said , there are two sequences ( one where a soldier gets a devastating note from his wife , and another where one of the main characters is killed ) that are nothing short of incredible . \\nthe performances are phenominal all around . \\nthe two standouts are nick nolte and newcomer jim caviezel , both of whom should have been nominated for oscars . \\nnolte is riveting and intense as the colonel in charge of the operation . \\nhis character is hard , mean , and somewhat reckless with the lives of his men , and yet nolte somehow manages to evoke sympathy for him . \\ncaviezel is forever questioning the nature of war , his place in it , and if there\\'s any deeper meaning to the hell that he\\'s going through . \\nhe is absolutely perfect - genuine , sympathetic , sincere , and yet strong when he needs to be . \\nalthough restricted to a relatively small role , sean penn is also very good as the company\\'s pessimistic seargent . \\nas to how it stacks up to \" saving private ryan \" - it was my second favorite movie of 1998 , \" ryan \" was my first . \\nit\\'s really hard to compare the two - they are so , so different - so i won\\'t , beyond saying that spielberg\\'s film had more of an impact on me . \\nhowever , the two are comparable from the standpoint of quality ( i can easily see why someone would \" the thin red line \" above \" ryan ) . \\ni highly recommend both of them , and consider them to be the two best war movies ever made . \\nall in all , \" the thin red line \" is filmmaking of an incredibly high order . \\nit\\'s slight faults are easily offset by the sheer brilliance of what is done right . \\nit\\'s a real shame that it tanked at the box office - films this unconventional , powerful , and thought-provoking don\\'t come along very often . \\n',\n",

       "  b\"a welcome cinematic trend over the past couple of years has been to make the works of shakespeare more accessible to the younger audiences who are the vast majority of moviegoers by contemporizing the bard and altering the settings to familiar surroundings . \\na prime example of this is 1999's 10 things i hate about you , which was basically the taming of the shrew in a high school . \\nless successful was last year's adaptation of hamlet with ethan hawke as the heir apparent of the denmark corp . here the setting was the corporate world of new york . \\nnow comes o , a faithful retelling of one of the most tragic of shakespeare's tragedies . \\nlike 10 things i hate about you , the stage is a high school - a private prep school where odin james ( mekhi phifer ) is the on-court general , the basketball team's standout player . \\njulia stiles , featured in 10 things i hate about you as well as performing ophelia in hawke's hamlet , plays desi brable , odin's girlfriend , whose father also happens to be dean of the institution . \\njosh hartnett ( pearl harbor ) is on hand for the villainy , playing the scheming hugo , who sets the tragic wheels in motion . \\no was actually filmed a couple of years ago , but was shelved because of the columbine high school tragedy . \\nthe movie , directed by tim blake nelson - best known for his co-starring role in o brother , where art thou ? \\n- and written by brad kaaya , is very grim . \\nan air of tragedy weighs it down from the opening scene to the closing credits . \\nand that is how it should be . \\nof all of shakespeare's tragedies , othello is the most harrowing , not because of any body count , but because of the psychological havoc wreaked by iago , whose motivation in the sheer pleasure of his treachery . \\nkaaya's profane-filled script - after all , these are high school kids - does offer hugo a subtle motive of sorts . \\nthe young man considers himself the basketball team's prime utility man who does a little bit of everything - pass , shoot , rebound - but is constantly in the shadow of odin . \\nplus his father , the team's coach - played with a ferocious intensity by martin sheen - showers more love and concern on his star player than on his own flesh and blood . \\nthe script follows the familiar lines of the classic . \\nhugo begins dropping hints to odin concerning desi's fidelity , eroding the star's confidence in those he considers closest to him , affecting both his relationships and his game . \\nit all ends in blood , of course , which is why the movie was originally shelved . \\nthe performances in o vary . \\nphifer is at first cocky and self-assured , emotions he handles with ease . \\nhe also does quite well displaying odin's darker side ; his defensive sensitivity about being the only black at the institution , his growing distrust of those he loved , his rage and the erosion of his belief system . \\nhartnett is appropriately cool and machiavellian as he weaves his deadly web of lies and deceit , turning friend against friend , and lover against lover . \\nstiles seems a bit stilted , but occasionally also rises to the occasion , moving from adoration to confusion to fear of her young knight . \\nthe film does contain a few missteps : a subplot involving hugo's theft of the school mascot is left hanging . \\nalso desi's actions concerning michael ( andrew keegan ) , odin's former teammate and best friend who was kicked off the team because of one of hugo's machinations , is puzzling . \\nwhy she would continually be seen with michael - however innocent the circumstances - when she knows her man suspects the two of cheating behind his back . \\nit is irrational . \\nbut these are minor carpings . \\noverall , o is a stylish and faithful adaptation . \\nif nothing else , it may encourage some people to read the original text , and that will counterbalance the severity of this feature . \\n\",\n",

       "  b'when a someone journeys to the theater to see a comedy , he always risks having to sit through inanity such as what we recently saw in films like edtv and office space . \\nit really is too bad that comedies are so hit- and-miss , because when a moviegoer goes in a theater expecting to be amused , it really is a shame when the alleged comedy fails to deliver . \\nbut weep not , dear readers , because the latest comedy out of the hollywood movie mill is nothing less than a sure bet . \\naustin powers : the spy who shagged me is one of the funniest things i\\'ve had the pleasure to see in a long time ; a completely looney , delightful parody of the often pretentious james bond flicks . \\nif all comedies ( or even half ; or - - what am i saying ? \\n-- even a fifth of them ) could be this consistently hysterical , i would take up residence at my local multiplex . \\neven more to this movie\\'s credit is the fact that it is a sequel to the 1997 sleeper/cult hit austin powers : international man of mystery . \\nthe original came out of nowhere ; it was a low-budget , eccentric movie that many expected to flop like a leslie nielsen parody . \\nall of a sudden it was being quoted by teenagers all over america . \\nironically , powers\\' \" yeeeeah baby , yeah ! \" \\nhas almost become an icon of the late 90s . \\nthus another installment was inevitable , but it\\'s also undoubtedly welcome . \\nthe spy who shagged me is one of the most unrestrained , over- the-top comedies i have ever seen in my entire life . \\nit brings back most of the characters from its predecessor ( even if only briefly ) and adds new ones . \\naustin powers ( mike myers ) , a swinging hipster from the 60s transported into the 90s has to go back to his own time to get back his mojo ( oh , you\\'ll figure it out ) , which dr . evil ( meyers again ) has stolen . \\nhe enlists the help of a gorgeous secret agent felicity shagwell ( now that his prior sidekick vanessa has been properly disposed of in a hilarious opening sequence ) , played without much distinguishable gusto by heather graham and together they go back to the 60s to defeat dr . evil yet again . \\nsurprisingly , the real star is dr . evil rather than austin . \\nhe gets most of the screen time because he was so popular in the first movie . \\nperhaps this is true because he is portrayed and written so affectionately . \\ninstead of being the scheming , villainous mad scientist we might expect from a character like this he is a bumbling , often sweet mad scientist wannabe . \\nthe spy who shagged me has much of the same stuff we saw in the original , but that\\'s okay by me because the original left us wanting more . \\nby the time that one was over we haven\\'t had nearly our share of shag jokes , crude puns and powers\\' antics and this sequel satisfies our appetites . \\neven by its conclusions , i\\'m still not sure i\\'ve had my fill of bits like \" do you smoke after sex ? \" \\n \" i don\\'t know , baby , i never looked . \" \\nthis may seem awfully immature of me , but understand that the austin powers series , unlike most of the crap hollywood feeds us these days , is genuinely funny . \\ni don\\'t know if i\\'ve ever laughed harder at any movie than i did during the jerry springer send up or the indubitably hilarious \" just the two of us \" rendition by dr . evil and his new miniature clone named \" mini-me \" . \\ni don\\'t have any pretensions that this is particularly smart social satire or anything of the sort . \\nindeed there is little beyond the joy a viewer feels when he sees something that is able to entertain him as much as this movie did . \\nbut as far as i\\'m concerned , that is enough . \\n ? 1999 eugene novikov &#137 ; \\n',\n",
       "  b'i know that \" funnest \" isn\\'t a word . \\n \" fun \" is a noun , and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective . \\nbut that\\'s the word that came to me right after viewing \" chicken run . \" \\nno wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions , like \" that was the funnest movie i\\'ve ever seen ! \" \\nso to hell with webster\\'s -- \" chicken run \" is one of the funnest movies i\\'ve seen in a while . \\ni can\\'t remember the last time i\\'ve seen anything funner . \\nthe chickens at tweedy\\'s farm are up to something . \\nliving in a concentration camp-like atmosphere , they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught , subsequently spending day after day in the coal box . \\none night , a brash american rooster flies in over the fence , calling himself rocky ( mel gibson ) , famous flying rooster and circus performer . \\nrocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly , and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs . tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farm\\'s egg-selling plan for a pie-selling plan . \\nshe orders a huge pie-making machine , cackling , \" chickens go in ; pies come out . \" \\nwhat sort of pies ? \\nchicken pies , of course . \\nco-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : \" creature comforts , \" \" the wrong trousers , \" and \" a close shave . \" \\nthe latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures . \\npart of what made the \" wallace \" films brilliantly entertaining was park\\'s uncanny ability to make an old story seem new . \\n \" the wrong trousers , \" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and \" a close shave \" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories . \\nbut in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived . \\nnow teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in \" chicken run . \" \\nthe plot is largely lifted from \" the great escape \" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement . \\nthing is , the film doesn\\'t feel like it\\'s been lifted from somewhere else ; \" chicken run \" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done . \\npart of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? \\npark and lord milk the incongruity for all it\\'s worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is . \\nbut they\\'re * chickens * , so it\\'s funny to us . \\nanother thing that helps \" chicken run \" ( and most of park\\'s films ) succeed is the animators\\' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they\\'re cribbing . \\nthere are references to \" the great escape , \" obviously , and \" stalag 17 . \" \\nthe chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both \" raiders of the lost ark \" and \" indiana jones and the temple of doom . \" \\nthere\\'s even a nod to \" the blues brothers , \" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson\\'s nationality and film history . \\nthe \" braveheart \" reference is a hoot if you catch it . \\nwhen you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , \" chicken run \" is downright brilliant in its execution . \\nconsider this : since july of last year , i\\'ve seen dozens upon dozens of \" blair witch project \" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online . \\nout of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome . \\nwhy ?

       "  b'i must admit i\\'m going to be a bit biased in my review of the new romantic comedy serendipity , because that also defines how i met my current girlfriend . \\nthe magic and mystery of our fated encounter is also embodied in the quirkiness and freshness of the very funny and very romantic serendipity . \\ni am not a big fan of the romantic comedy genre , but something drew me to this film . \\nmaybe it was the casting of the underrated jeremy piven in a supporting role , and the hilarious eugene levy . \\nmaybe it was my hope that john cusack would get the redemption he justly deserves after such crap as high fidelity , con air , and pushing tin . \\nbut maybe it was because i feel as giddy as a school kid right now with this whole romantic thing currently in my life . \\nthe story of serendipity is simple . \\ntwo people , john trager ( john cusack ) and sara thomas ( kate beckinsale , looking ever so hot ) , have a chance encounter over a pair of gloves -- with buck henry smack dab in the middle . \\ncharmed beyond repair , these two knuckleheads grab a sundae together at a caf ? called serendipity , talk about that irresponsible thing called fate and the avenues it leads people down , and spend a few hours at the local ice skating rink . \\nbut with each of them already involved with other parties , sara has john write his name and number on a $5 bill and she writes her name and number on a copy of love in the time of cholera . \\nsara declares that if this \" thing \" -- let\\'s just call it love -- is destined to happen , fate will bring them together in the future . \\nyears later and on opposite coasts of america , john and sara -- both engaged but still unsure whether they have found their soul mates -- decide to seek each other out to rest their doubts . \\nwhat happens then is an enjoyable and often hilarious cat-and-mouse game with the fates - involving such items as mistaken identity , a graduate homage , john corbett as a freaky new age musician , and eugene levy as an irate and crazed salesman -- to find out if that \" thing \" was right after all . \\nfortunately , first-time screenwriter marc klein has sketched strong , well-rounded , characters to propel a predictable and corny narrative . \\ncoupled with deft directing by michael chelsom ( director of the very unfunny town and country and the very funny funny bones ) and the use of time-lapse camera work to illustrate the passage of years -- the film comes off with genuine believability and sincerity . \\nboth piven and molly shannon make nice sidekick characters \\non the flipside , films such as you\\'ve got mail , made in heaven , and even high fidelity are the quiet inspirations for the film\\'s main journey at hand . \\nbut it\\'s what happens to the unexpecting characters left behind in the romantic wake after john and sara find happiness this is the most unsettling part of the picture . \\n',\n",

       "  b\"i think that any competent member of the human race who's ever seen a movie--any movie--could probably predict just about every turn in the wedding singer . \\neven though i try very hard to not predict films as i'm watching them ( especially not romantic comedies ) , the plot of this particular film just advanced before me seconds , and sometimes minutes , before i actually saw it happen on screen . \\nbut i don't care . \\nnot even a little . \\nmy reasons for this are simple : 1 ) adam sandler is great . \\n2 ) drew barrymore is great . \\n3 ) the movie is so funny . \\nthere are parts that left me gasping for air because i was laughing so hard . \\ni haven't laughed this hard in a movie since austin powers . \\nsandler plays robby hart , a wedding singer who once had dreams of being in a rock band and writing his own music . \\nin the opening scenes , he seems like a happy-go-lucky wedding singer , at least partially enjoying his profession and doing a rather good job of talking down a really drunk individual ( steve buscemi ) who decides that his brother's wedding is a good place to tell the whole world that his life , up to that point , was utter pointlessness . \\na week later , at his own wedding , he is left standing at the altar by his ex-fianc ? e , linda ( angela featherstone ) . \\nwith his life in complete disarray , he meets julia ( barrymore ) , a waitress . \\nshe is engaged to glenn ( matthew glave ) , and is to marry him in about three months . \\njulia and robby become good friends when she enlists him to help with the wedding plans . \\nsoon ( and predictably ) it becomes pretty clear that glenn is a jerk , and that robby and julia really love each other . \\noh sure , it's trite . \\nand if anyone making this film expected us to , like , feel suspense or something while watching the wedding singer , then they truly underestimated their audience . \\nwhat makes the story bearable , aside from the terrific costumes and 80s music , are the performances . \\nbarrymore is simply adorable here ( i've never seen her look so close to the way she did in et ) . \\nnot only is she pleasant to look at , but her acting job here really is a good one--and it doesn't hurt that the character is likable and adequately well-written . \\nand the jerk , played in full-force by graves , is just as despicable as any villain in any romantic comedy i've ever seen . \\nnaturally , the true star here is sandler . \\ni think the guy is flat-out hilarious . \\nhe can say something that just isn't funny , and his delivery makes me laugh . \\nhis comedic performance here equals that of happy gilmore , but in this film he goes much further and proves to me that he can , indeed , hold his own as a leading man in a romantic comedy . \\nwhereas his roles in his previous films kind of had sandler playing sandler , the wedding singer gives him a character that , for the first time , he actually has to fit into . \\nas far as i'm concerned he succeeded , and this film is testimony that he does , in fact , have some range in his talents . \\nand the movie is just so funny . \\nperhaps the best moment is when he sings a song for julia that he claims is a little uneven because he began writing it while in a good mood and finished it after his fianc ? e abandoned him . \\nthis is the part that literally had me groping for a breath of air . \\nand while the film , like all romantic comedies , takes a hiatus from laughs towards the end because the plot has to finish up , there are more than enough truly hilarious moments in the first hour that make up for any slumps in progress during the second half . \\nmy formal complaints for the wedding singer aren't very important . \\nthe film is predicable , but who cares ? \\nthe characters are extremely likable , the movie is ridiculously funny , and the experience is simply enjoyable . \\nin addition to this , i can't imagine anyone seeing the preview and not wanting to see the film . \\nin that order , i conclude that it is pointless for me to even have written this review . \\ni just want everyone to know that i laughed . \\na lot . \\n\",\n",

\\nlet you go . . my \\nfather , my luis , who made me . . . who will look after me , my dark angel , when you are gone ? \" \\nluis : \" everything will be alright . . \" \\nclaudia : \" do you really believe that ? \" \\nand then they hug emotionally . \\nmoments like those displayed above and luis\\' self-pity is a bit tiresome . \\nhowever rice\\'s script is otherwise strong and well structured , bringing up humor and comic episodes , that were more or less hidden in the book . \\nwhen lestat finds claudia\\'s dead dressmaker , whom she has killed , he cries out : \" who will make you that dress now ? \\nbe a little practical . . . . never \\nin the house ! \" \\nmoments like that are both entertaining and appealing . \\nneil jordan\\'s direction is beautiful and sensual as he plays with interesting issues like eternity , homosexuality , love and loneliness . \\nhis gothic saga is not meant to scare , but to display these issues differently . \\nwrapped up in mystery , his new , original picture brings vampire-films to a new height . \\n',\n",

       "  b\"there exists a litany of differences between a successful action movie and a successful suspense movie . \\naction movies are typically devoid of plot other than a simple byline which can string together several explosive sequences , while suspense movies hinge on plot and subtlety and the ability to bring everything full-circle . \\nfor fans of both genres , however , realism is key . \\naction fans want to know that the weapons and methods their heroes are using are authentic , and suspense fans want everything to fall into an explainable framework by the movie's end . \\non this advice , director john frankenheimer ( the island of dr . \\nmoreau ) strives for realism in an interestingly dynamic balance of suspense and action for his latest thriller , ronin . \\nthe depth of intrigue in ronin is quite amazing , considering the fare that's fallen into the same category over the last few years . \\nthe script , written by j . d . zeik in his big-screen debut , approaches levels of complexity that had people spinning away from mission : impossible two years ago . \\na certain number of people will be lost by this , but afficianados will appreciate it all the more and return multiple times . \\nfrankenheimer masters the script with poise , and tells us a dark but stoically realistic tale of a group of post-cold war mercenaries working to earn their paycheck . \\nhis ability to convey feeling and character while promoting explosiveness and tense atmosphere works well here , and ronin becomes a better movie because of it . \\nrobert de niro headlines this cast of noteworthies in a performance that is the most outstanding of his in quite some time . \\nhe takes command and offers much gravity as the ex-spy sam , a man who's called to france to help a shady operations controller named dierdre ( natascha mcelhone ) recover a package . \\nthe package becomes the central motivator for the entire cast , especially once the requisite double-crossing begins , and its role is skillfully penned by zeik . \\nat times , however , zeik's tale becomes almost too reminiscent of mission : impossible - de niro might easily become tom cruise , the package might become cruise's computer disk . \\nfortunately , the focus here is almost entirely on the package , whereas in mission the script was more concerned with the double-cross and why it happened . \\nthe action content is impressive , and it lives up to the hints given in previews . \\nthe only fans who will be disappointed are those who expect full-blown combat scenes and instead are forced to suffer through moments of slowness . \\nronin does take a degree of intelligence to follow all of the nuance from start to finish , but even the uninitiated will be able to keep a grasp on most characters mand subplots . \\nthe suspense tapers off considerably by the end , a bit of a drawback because of its height at the movie's open . \\nconsidering these factors it's good to see that ronin was a project that turned out well , and it's another good bet this month . \\nsince quality is usually sparse during the early fall months , it's definitely worth the visit . \\n\",\n",

\" \\nthe world in gridlock\\'d is just as frustrating as the world in falling down , but the cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time . \\nhall has some interesting things to say about what we expect from the system , but perhaps not enough of them . \\na significant chunk of gridlock\\'d is devoted to spoon and stretch\\'s flight from d-reper and from the police , and those sub-plots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments . \\nin one scene , stretch scares off d-reper by getting chummy with a police officer ; another presents that old chestnut of the two mistakenly-suspected heroes in a public place watching a television news report of the crime which shows their pictures . \\nthe entire sequence of events seems designed merely as an excuse to get spoon and stretch running , while the other primary plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time . \\nhall also plays with gratuitous inserts of drug paraphernalia and flashbacks to the day before the film\\'s main events , perhaps making a particular effort to point out the talent the characters are wasting through self-destructive behavior . \\noh , the irony of it . \\ntupac shakur made a career in music and movies playing the hard case , and living the life to back it up . \\nin gridlock\\'d , shakur gets the chance to play someone who has seen enough of the way his life could go to know that it scares him . \\nspoon is an idea for a character at best as written by hall , but shakur displays an intelligence and survival instinct which struggle with his addiction . \\nmostly it comes through those eyes , eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from the infamous gangsta . \\nit is spoon who plays conscience to stretch\\'s pure appetite , and roth plays stretch with a gleeful self-destructiveness ( he reveals that he is hiv positive even as he is preparing to shoot up again ) which is as much an obstacle to spoon\\'s goal as any agency or enemy . \\ngridlock\\'d\\'s most cruelly comic scene finds stretch \" helping \" spoon get into an emergency room by repeatedly stabbing him with a tiny pocket knife , and it becomes an appropriate symbol for how the company he keeps has slowly drained the life out of him . \\nwith friends like that , spoon doesn\\'t need enemies , and shakur looks at stretch with the tired eyes of a man who has seen too much . \\nthe tragedy now is that we won\\'t get more chances to see those eyes again . \\n',\n",
       "  b\"even if i did not know that director and co-writers james wong and jeffrey reddick of the creepy final destination helped create the hit television show the x-files , i would have inevitably made a connection . \\nthe similarities are very apparent from the inexplicable phenomenon- like plot , to the mysterious characters , to the overall dark , ominous settings . \\nit would have been perfectly fitting to see fbi agents mulder and scully investigate this case , they witness stuff like this on a weekly basis ( in fact mulder and scully would have been a much more welcome change to the bland one dimensional fbi agents seen in this movie ) . \\nanother more important similarity , is that both succeed in entertaining and thrilling at the same time . \\nthis is a great accomplishment for a teen horror movie , especially when compared to some of the trash , of the same genre , released in the last couple of years ( urban legend and i still know what you did last summer are classic examples from the bunch ) . \\nwhat helps final destination is its unique premise . \\nunlike your average horror flick in which some invincible psycho with a knife chases blonde cheerleaders , the villain presented is unusual , it's the grim reaper . \\nthis being already has predestined when and how you will die . \\naccording to the brief history lesson given in this film , everyone was meant to die at a certain time , some people at 100 , others at 17 , whatever death chooses . \\nwhat is unique about death is that it's already dead , so you can't really kill it . \\nthe only way to defeat death is to cheat it ; the question is how do you do that ? \\nthis dilemma is what faces alex and a group of teenagers . \\nalex has been having some dreams that the airplane which will take his class on a trip to paris will crash , leaving no survivors . \\nalex begins to realize that his dreams are a little too real and eventually gets himself and six others kicked off the plane right before it takes off . \\nshortly after , the plane does indeed crash leaving some of the seven survivors confused and others feeling immortal . \\nhowever , death isn't through with them yet . \\nit gradually kills off the seven one by one , leaving those currently still alive frantically trying to trick death again . \\nthe plot allows for some of the most creative , original death scenes i have seen in a while . \\nsome scenes build up the perfect amount of tension until an elaborate climax , others are so unexpected they will leave your jaw wide open in shock . \\ncreativity and originality are two adjectives lacking in most horror films nowadays but final destination is not like most horror films . \\nsure , it has your traditional share of jerks and outsiders ( ali larter's character is particularly annoying ) , but the shocks , from the beginning to the end , are extremely entertaining . \\nalso director wong has the sense not to take the movie too seriously . \\nhe knows its just another entertaining guilty pleasure that won't win any academy awards ( not even a golden globe ) . \\nthe myriad of inside jokes and gags ( the characters are named after famous horror directors , one character who plays a jerk is named carter , like x-files creator chris carter , and a song by john denver , who died in a plane crash , plays whenever death is near ) show this movie is a bunch of guys having a good time making a movie . \\nand from this , i had a great time watching the movie . \\n\",\n",
       "  b'bob the happy bastard\\'s quickie review : \\ni must admit , no doubt\\'s single \" new \" is quite catchy . \\nit was bouncy and energetic enough to get me to go see this new film from director doug limon , the man who had brought us the humorous swingers a little while back . \\nthe result ? \\na movie that\\'s just as good as that song , really . \\nit follows the lives of several individuals over the course of one weekend . \\nfirst we hear about a grocery bagger ( sara polley ) who runs into a monetary situation problem and ends up selling bogus drugs at a rave ( with bad results , as a drug dealer feels he\\'s been swindled by her ) ; then comes the story of an english grocery store worker ( same store ) who heads to vegas for the weekend with friends , where sex , gunplay , and stolen car trouble come into play ; then we see the story of two gay movie actors ( played by scott wolf and jay mohr ) who deal with a cop\\'s strange insurance presentation and hitting a girl ( sara ) with their car ; and , finally , we come to another grocery worker ( katie holmes ) who has a strange fascination with said drug dealer ( the one mentioned earlier ) . \\nreally , it\\'s all confusing to keep track of in review format , your best bet is to just , well , go . \\nthe movie features some very good acting from all angles , and limon adds the same humorous energy he had with swingers to this particular product . \\nthe dialogue is pretty snappy and the resolution is pretty well realized , not going for the sappy happy ending nor the dreaded bad ending . \\nthink of it as a , well , ending . \\nthe intertwining of stories is a particularly good element to the movie , as it\\'s never really confusing and tells different sides of the story , like sliding doors kinda did . \\nhowever , it\\'s better suited for the younger generation who want a little spice in their flicks , which sliding doors kinda isn\\'t . \\n',\n",

       "  b'a fully loaded entertainment review - website coming in july ! \\ni didn\\'t really expect very much when i rented stuart saves his family . \\nthe movie bombed at the box office , and i had never really liked the saturday night live sketch on which the movie was based . \\nmy real concern , though , was the general reputation of snl-related movies translating to the big screen with less-than-stellar results ( half-baked , anyone ? ) \\ni was surprised to discover a truly entertaining , often hilarious yet also touching little film . \\nit is an al franken production through-and-through , who not only created the title character but also wrote and starred in the picture . \\nfor those of you who don\\'t know , al franken plays a guy named stuart smalley , who has a really annoying show on a public-access station about increasing your self-esteem , etc . although not a licensed therapist , stuart smalley is , as the program proudly boasts , \" a graduate of several 12-step programs . \" \\nstuart is doing well enough with his tv show , but he keeps getting distracted by family troubles . \\nstuart\\'s relatives are a mess : his dad and brother ( harris yulin and vincent d\\'onofrio , respectively ) are alcoholics , his sister is overweight and getting over another divorce , and his mom is in constant self-denial and solves all perceived problems by baking . \\nthen , disaster strikes . \\nstuart accidentally insults the manager of the station and gets his show revoked . \\nhe is forced to move back in with his family after he can no longer support himself , and there the comedy truly picks up . \\nfranken wrote all of the characters not just as cliches or stereotypes , but as sharply-drawn , real people . \\nalthough smalley\\'s dad has always imbibed too much , stuart can still recall times when his father seemed like an okay guy . \\nalso , after an accident towards the end of the movie , both stuart and the audience learn that there is more to his mother than previously thought . \\nalthough filled with small , very funny scenes , stuart saves his family also has its share of dramatic moments , especially towards the conclusion . \\nfor a lightweight comedy , it handles these scenes especially well , often better than many so-called \" serious dramas \" of today . \\nall the more amazing is that such a movie comes from a saturday night live sketch that is essentially a one-joke bit . \\nif you feel like renting a comedy , and you haven\\'t seen this film , i definitely recommend you try this one out . \\nyou\\'ll laugh . . . you\\'ll \\ncry . . . . it\\'s \\nall there . \\n',\n",

       "  b\"martin scorsese's kundun , which chronicles roughly the first twenty years of the life of the currently exiled dalai lama , has been criticized for its lack of narrative structure . \\npersonally , i don't think it needs one : it works perfectly well as a study of tibetan buddhist culture and how communist china . \\nscorsese views the dalai lama the way many tibetans probably do , as a larger-than-life symbol of buddhist spirituality and political leadership : the only glimpses into his head come from several interesting yet oblique dream sequences , but his portrayal is appropriate for a film that concentrates on the political and spiritual rather than the personal . \\nthe set design and cinematography are outstanding , and while scorsese occasionally seems to get carried away with the spectacle , it helps to augment the cultural contrast when the dalai lama travels to china to meet chairman mao . \\npolitical art sometimes succumbs to the temptation to start shouting slogans , kundun does not : it succeeds in delivering its message in an artistically interesting way and without being overly manipulative . \\n\",\n",
       "  b'if there is one thing that bothers me about hollywood films it\\'s their predictable endings . \\nthe devil\\'s advocate has the atypical hollywood ending , when everything that should happen does . \\nunfortunately for the devil\\'s advocate , this ending nearly collapses in on itself , and ruins the entire film . \\nnevertheless , the film does provide two and a half hours of pure entertainment ( note to self : kill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film ) . \\ni don\\'t think i was quite prepared for this movie because the trailers made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan . \\nwell , it does contain this element , but what is not mentioned in the ads is the other plot elements ( and seemingly more interesting ones at that ) . \\nthe devil\\'s advocate begins in florida with an ongoing trial in session . \\nkevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) is the defense attorney , working for a client whom has been accused of raping a young girl . \\nhe ends up with a not-guilty verdict , despite an emotional testimony from the victim ( heather matarazzo ) . \\nhe leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann ( charlize theron ) where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jury . \\nhe accepts ( mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive ) and he flies to new york with his wife . \\nafter proving his worth for selecting juries ( and his perfect winning streak in court ) , the head of the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) , asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer . \\nhe graciously accepts , where he is treated almost as a god . \\nhe is given an incredible apartment ( which is bigger than my entire house now ) , and a hefty paycheck . \\nhis life seems to be on the rise . \\nand of course , his life suddenly begins to waver and slowly decline . \\nhe is attracted to fellow employee christabella ( connie nielson ) , and his wife begins to feel very lonely in her large apartment . \\nmary ann takes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice , especially if it is not wanted . \\nmeanwhile , kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen ( craig t . nelson ) who apparently murdered three people . \\nhe spends hours upon hours with this case , while forgetting his loving wife , who may or may not be going insane . \\nall of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself . \\nafter a while , things turn completely upside-down , as kevin\\'s wife claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends . \\na fellow employee is murdered in the park , and his mother ( judith ivey ) reveals information about kevin\\'s real father . \\nis it all just a big nightmare ? \\nor is john milton really satan , playing tricks with kevin\\'s life ? \\nthe devil\\'s advocate plays out fairly straight-forward , but for some odd reason , the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we don\\'t expect . \\nis this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed ? \\nif so , the devil\\'s advocate messes up completely , and ironically , i felt more depressed because of the ending as is now , than i would have if it had ended ten minutes early . \\ni went into the devil\\'s advocate expecting a shocking horror film , and that is exactly what i got . \\ni was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally , and that is what i got . \\nbut what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending ( did i mention that i didn\\'t like the ending ? ) . \\nthe producers of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending , they pull the rug out from under you . \\nfilms like se7en and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected , more or less . \\nwe know it is going to end in an unpredictable way . \\nthe devil\\'s advocate , on the other hand , ends unpredictably , not from us knowing a lot , but knowing nothing at all . \\nif that is confusing , i recommend watching the film , and then reading that again . \\nas for the film overall , i enjoyed the entire first two hours , being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study . \\nthe film runs like a well-built clock , slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax ( and an unpredictable one at that ) . \\nand then you settle in for a nice resolution , which does not occur . \\nit was at this point that i felt cheated . \\ntaking us on a terror ride of intrigue , we follow kevin lomax around , as he is the centerpiece of the film . \\neverything occurs from his perspective . \\nhe is our representation on screen ( sort of ) . \\nbut we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a game . \\ni don\\'t want to spoil the ending , so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself . \\nperhaps the most shocking thing about the devil\\'s advocate is the extreme amount of everything . \\nit earned its r rating for a reason . \\nthere is plenty of nudity , sex , violence , gore , and then you have gore , violence , sex , and more nudity . \\nthis film really isn\\'t subtle about anything , showing us everything . \\nit actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc-17 rating , as it is quite harsh . \\nhowever , the movie does have its merits , and nudity and sex are among those . \\ni don\\'t condone sex and nudity in films , but if its there , i might as well enjoy it . \\nthe biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch . \\nthe confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining , but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife , mary ann . \\nportrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron , mary ann\\'s problems are incredibly intense , and i found myself wanting to witness her decline . \\nthis may sound uncaring , but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her . \\nshe is the most interesting character on the screen , who is forced into a world where she is not wanted . \\nsomething the devil\\'s advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity , especially for a film of this nature . \\nthe story actually has something to say about humanity . \\nin one of the last scenes , john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his children ( he is satan , of course ) . \\nhe comments that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity . \\nthen , god sets up rules which contradict human nature . \\nthis semi-religious bashing is more humorous than frightening . \\nwhat milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud , partially thinking it was funny , but patially realizing it was true . \\nthese moral dilemmas are present throughout the devil\\'s advocate , giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing ( but i\\'m sure they came straight from the novel it was based on ) . \\nwhen a film has something to say about our society , it deserves to be watched . \\nthe cast of the devil\\'s advocate is one of the highlights , as we see memorable faces , and they put spins on those memorable faces we don\\'t expect . \\nheather matarazzo makes a brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case , and she does a great job . \\nprobably the big surprise of this film is keanu reeves . \\nhe has proven himself an uneven actor ( successes such as speed and bombs such as johnny mnemonic ) , but he tops himself with this performance . \\ni have never seen him more believable to date . \\nal pacino is of course the scene stealer . \\nhis devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson ( the witches of eastwick ) and max von sydow ( needful things ) . \\nhe could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes , but he remains completely believable ( if that is the correct term ) . \\njeffrey jones ( mostly known as the principal in ferris bueller\\'s day off ) also gives a good performance as eddie barzoon . \\njudith ivey manages a credible performance as the mother who holds a secret to kevin\\'s past . \\nconnie nielson is very effective in her role , and she also appears naked several times . \\none familiar face with a twist was \" coach \" star , craig t . nelson , who gives a very good performance . \\nthe devil\\'s advocate is rated r for sexuality , nudity , violence , language , and some gore . \\nat 144 minutes , this film moves along fairly quickly . \\nfor the first two hours , i sat completely engaged in the good performances and strong characters . \\nthe technical quality is also remarkable , with great special effects and a good musical score . \\ndirector taylor hackford has managed to create a very disturbing motion picture , only to ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minutes . \\ni guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that i went into the theater expecting

       "  b'one of the sweetest tales to ever be made , it\\'s a wonderful life isn\\'t perfect , but its good natured charm and beautiful performances light up the screen with glorious results . \\nprobably the greatest \" feel-good \" film of all time , it\\'s a wonderful life aims for the heart , and strikes with a golden arrow . \\non christmas eve , george bailey ( stewart ) is being prayed for by many in the small town of bedford falls . \\nyou see , george is in trouble , and he has always helped others who needed it . \\nthis one time , however , god answers his prayers , and sends down the lovable guardian angel clarence ( travers ) to try and save george . \\nclarence has got his own problems , however . \\nclarence is an angel without his wings , and each time the bell rings , the wings pass him by . \\nthe bailey case is a way for him to earn those magical wings and become a true angel . \\nbut before clarence can save george , he first has to go through a cliffs notes version of george bailey\\'s life . \\nwe see george sacrificing his hearing to save his brother\\'s life , sacrificing his college education to save the family business , sacrificing his dream of living far away to support his brother , and even sacrificing his life to make sure his brother is happy working somewhere else . \\nwhen the bank his family owns is in trouble , george gives away his honeymoon money to make sure the bank isn\\'t sold to the evil mr . potter ( barrymore ) , who wants nothing less than to get the baileys out of bedford falls . \\none christmas , potter gets his chance . \\nuncle billy bailey ( mitchell ) loses $8 , 000 of the bank\\'s money . \\nwithout the money , the bank must close down . \\ngeorge is stuck in a tremendous bind , and contemplates suicide . \\nclarence , the faithful servant , is there just to pick him up , and to show him what bedford would be like without george . \\nthis is all a lead-in to the very famous last scene , where george finally sees what true happiness is about . \\nit\\'s a wonderful life does have its faults . \\nthe movie is beginning to feel dated in the details , especially in the treatment of women and men . \\nthe sex roles in the film are weirdly out of place in the 90\\'s , like something out of a revisionist look . \\nall the men drink too much and slap their wives too much during some portions of the film . \\nthere are , however , endearing moments in all of this . \\ncapra puts in just enough humor mocking the sex roles of the 50\\'s to make the movie remarkably enjoyable . \\nthe story is hackneyed , and the ending feels , well , a little too sugarish . \\nthere\\'s this uneasy feeling of sugar over everything , especially the sequences where george is either in trouble , or helping somebody . \\nit\\'s a little too nice for my liking , at times . \\nthere is , however , enough humor , enough wit , and enough of jimmy stewart to get the movie through the middle part , which would be the most difficult . \\nbut watching it\\'s a wonderful life is never boring or difficult : it\\'s always interesting , right until the finale , which , for all its sugar , makes delightful sense and is beautifully done . \\ncapra does have his monumental cliches , but the actors relish them and overplay everything to perfection . \\ndonna reed is perfect as the loving , obeidient wife , and lionel barrymore is gloriously grump as mr . potter . \\neveryone else is magnificent , including bert and ernie ( ward bond and frank faylen ) . \\nthere is a general sense of goodness , as if everyone in the film knows that they are making a great film , and they relish that . \\nstewart , however , is the king of all of this . \\nhe is sometimes awkward , especially when saying \" merry christmas \" to all objects , animate or inanimate . \\nbut he is james stewart , and he\\'s lovably delightful throughout the film . \\nhave i complained ? \\ni shouldn\\'t have . \\nthis is a really good movie . \\nno , this is a great movie . \\nbetter yet , this is a phenomenal movie . \\nthere is a reason classics are invented : to make sure that people will always have great movies to aid them in their quest for living life . \\nthis is one of those films . \\nit is a \" feel-good \" movie , something people complain a little too much about . \\nbut capra\\'s reworking of \" a christmas carol \" is the greatest christmas movie of all time . \\nthere , i\\'ve said it . \\ni have to admit , the first time i saw this , i saw it with my family , including my 11 year old kid sister . \\nthey all loved it . \\nthey loved george , his wife , his troubles , and the beautiful ending . \\nis it a little too sugar-coated ? \\nmaybe . \\nno matter . \\nthis is a film that should be watched time and time again , with families around a coffee table , and eggnog on the plate . \\nit is a film that just makes you feel good about life , family , and hope . \\nit is the perfect christmas film , flaws and all . \\nit is frank capra\\'s greatest acheivement , and that really does say a lot . \\nfor about 121 out of 129 minutes , this movie is flawless . \\nthe rest can be excused : no film is perfectly flawless . \\ni can\\'t get over how much i love this movie , and how much you will , after watching it , digesting it , and sitting with your family , appreciating how special life really is . \\n',\n",
       "  b'capsule : side-splitting comedy that follows its own merciless logic almost through to the end . . . \\nbut not without providing a good deal of genuine laughs . \\nmost comedies these days have one flaw . \\nthey\\'re not funny . \\nthey think they\\'re funny , but they are devoid of anything really penetrating or dastardly . \\noccasionally a good funny movie sneaks past the deadening hollywood preconceptions of humor and we get a real gem : ruthless people , for instance , which established a microcosm of a setup and played it out to the bitter end . \\nliar liar is built the same way and is just about as funny . \\nthis is one of the few movies i\\'ve seen where i was laughing consistently almost all the way through : instead of a couple of set-pieces that inspired a laugh ( think of the dismal fatal instinct ) , the whole movie works like clockwork . \\njim carrey playes a high-powered lawyer , to whom lying is as natural as breathing . \\nthere is one thing he takes seriously , though : his son , and we can sense the affection that they have for each other right away . \\nbut his wife is divorced and seeing another man , and now it looks like they may move away together . \\nthe son goes with them , of course . \\nthe movie sets up this early material with good timing and a remarkable balance of jim carrey\\'s over-the-top persona with reality . \\nthen the plot springs into action : after being snubbed ( not deliberately ) by his father at his birthday , the kid makes a wish as he blows out the birthday candles : that for just one day , dad can\\'t lie . \\nhe gets the wish . \\nwhat happens next is sidesplitting . \\neverything turns into a confrontation : when cornered by a bum for some change , he shouts , \" no ! \\ni\\'m not giving you any money because i know you\\'ll spend it on booze ! \\nall i want to do is to get to the office without having to step over the debris of our decaying society ! \" \\nhe can\\'t even get into an elevator without earning a black eye . \\nand what\\'s worse , he\\'s now gotten himself into an expensive divorce settlement that requires him to twist the truth like abstract wire sculpture . \\ncarrey , who i used to find unfunny , has gotten better at his schtick , even if it\\'s a limited one . \\nhe uses it to great effect in this movie . \\nthere is a scene where he tries to test his ability to lie and nearly demolishes his office in the process ( there\\'s a grin breaking out across my face right now , just remembering the scene ) . \\nhe can\\'t even write the lie ; his fingers twitch , his body buckles like someone in the throes of cyanide poisoning , and when he tries to talk it\\'s like he\\'s speaking in tongues . \\nequally funny is a scene where he beats himself to a pulp ( don\\'t ask why ) , tries to drink water to keep from having outbursts in the courtroom ( it fails , with semi-predictable results ) , and winds up biting the bullet when he gets called into the boardroom to have everyone ask what they think of them . \\nthis scene alone may force people to stop the tape for minutes on end . \\nthe movie sustains its laughs and also its flashes of insight until almost the end . \\na shame , too , because the movie insists on having a big , ridiculous climax that involves carrey\\'s character flagging down a plane using a set of motorized stairs , then breaking his leg , etc . a simple reconciliation would do the trick . \\nwhy is this stupid pent-up climax always obligatory ? \\nit\\'s not even part of the movie\\'s real agenda . \\nthankfully , liar liar survives it , and so does carrey . \\nmaybe they were being merciful , on reflection . \\nif i\\'d laughed any more , i might have needed an iron lung . \\n',\n",
       "  b\"good films are hard to find these days . \\ngreat films are beyond rare . \\nproof of life , russell crowe's one-two punch of a deft kidnap and rescue thriller , is one of those rare gems . \\na taut drama laced with strong and subtle acting , an intelligent script , and masterful directing , together it delivers something virtually unheard of in the film industry these days , genuine motivation in a story that rings true . \\nconsider the strange coincidence of russell crowe's character in proof of life making the moves on a distraught wife played by meg ryan's character in the film -- all while the real russell crowe was hitching up with married woman meg ryan in the outside world . \\ni haven't seen this much chemistry between actors since mcqueen and mcgraw teamed up in peckinpah's masterpiece , the getaway . \\nbut enough with the gossip , let's get to the review . \\nthe film revolves around the kidnapping of peter bowman ( david morse ) , an american engineer working in south america who is kidnapped during a mass ambush of civilians by anti-government soldiers . \\nupon discovering his identity , the rebel soldiers decide to ransom him for $6 million . \\nthe only problem is that the company peter bowman works for is being auctioned off , and no one will step forward with the money . \\nwith no choice available to her , bowman's wife alice ( ryan ) hires terry thorne ( crowe ) , a highly skilled negotiator and rescue operative , to arrange the return of her husband . \\nbut when things go wrong -- as they always do in these situations -- terry and his team ( which includes the most surprising casting choice of the year : david caruso ) take matters into their own hands . \\nthe film is notable in that it takes this very simple story line and creates a complex and intelligent character-driven vehicle filled with well-written dialogue , shades of motivation , and convincing acting by all the actors . \\nthe script is based on both a book ( the long march to freedom ) and a magazine article pertaining to kidnap/ransom situations , and the story has been sharply pieced together by tony gilroy , screenwriter of the devil's advocate and dolores claiborne . \\nthe biggest surprise for me was not the chemistry between crowe and ryan , but that between crowe and david caruso . \\ndug out from b-movie hell , caruso pulls off a gutsy performance as crowe's right hand gun while providing most of the film's humor . \\nryan cries a lot and smokes too many cigarettes , david morse ends up getting everyone at the guerilla camp to hate him , and crowe provides another memorable acting turn as the stoic , gunslinger character of terry thorne . \\nthe most memorable pieces of the film lie in its action scenes . \\nthe bulk of those scenes , which bookend the movie , work extremely well as establishment and closure devices for all of the story's characters . \\nthe scenes are skillfully crafted and executed with amazing accuracy and poise . \\ndirector taylor hackford mixes both his old-school style of filmmaking with the dizziness of a lars von trier film . \\nproof of life is a thinking man's action movie . \\nit is a film about the choices men and women make in the face of love and war , and the sacrifices one makes for those choices -- the sacrifices that help you sleep at night . \\n\",\n",
       "  b'urban legend surprised me . \\nbased on the last few films the genre has produced ( including but not exclusive to the likes of i know what you did last summer , disturbing behavior and the disappointing halloween : h20 ) , i was positive that i was in store for another mildly entertaining but silly and ultimately boring rehash of the scream phenomena . \\nthankfully , legend rose above it\\'s soggy premise to become not only a hip , scary and stylish entertainment , but also what will probably become one of the best films of the year . \\nyou\\'re all familiar with the plot ; a bunch of overly horny teenagers get systematically slaughtered by a masked maniac who\\'s identity is not revealed until the closing moments of the film when it turns out to be , you guessed it ; everybody\\'s favorite veteran of the whodunit flicks . . . the \\nonly person you didn\\'t suspect ! \\nhowever , just because legend doesn\\'t really break any new ground as far as literary or even technical achievements go does not mean that it can\\'t qualify as first-class entertainment . \\nit was , believe it or not , one of the funnest times i\\'ve had at the movies all year . \\nthe thing is , i\\'m not really sure what made this particular stab ( pardon the pun ) at the genre seem so fresh and alive . \\nmaybe it was the above-par performances by the movie\\'s two leads ( jared leto and \" cybil \" actress alicia witt ) . \\nor , it could have been the on- target direction by jamie blanks . \\nmore likely , though , it was because of the inspired premise . \\ni don\\'t think i need to tell you that a killer hacking people up ala urban folklore is much more frightening than a killer fisherman . \\nurban legend begins with a sequence that reminded me of the classic scream opener , not so much in plotting as in attention to detail that makes for an absolutely chilling teaser for the rest of the film . \\na pretty young coed is driving down a deserted road when ( gasp ! ) a gas problem ( hee-hee ) forces her to stop at an equally deserted gas station for a refill . \\none problem , though . \\nwould you want to stop at a station run by brad dourif ? \\ni thought not . \\npredictably , the attendant ends up coaxing her into the main building to sort out a problem with the credit card company . \\nit\\'s odd , though , when you pick up a phone to realize that nobody\\'s on the other line . \\nnaturally , the potential victim escapes into her car and drives off . \\nand the when we least expect it . . . whack ! ! ! \\na decapitation . \\nit turns out that the creepy looking attendant was just trying to warn her about the maniac in the back seat of the car . \\nso who is it this time ? \\nthe obvious candidate is the slightly off-kilter professor at the college the girl went to ( none other than freddy kruger himself , robert englund ) , who teaches a class on urban legends . \\na-ha . \\nor could it be the fame-hungry local journalist ( leto ) looking for a meaty story to put on his resume ? \\nlike all movies of this nature , one of the chief pleasures is trying to guess whodunit . \\nand it turns out to be , of course , the one you didn\\'t suspect . \\ni\\'m not going to pretend urban legend is anything more than it is , but i must give credit where credit is due . \\nand this flick definitely deserves credit for being what not many other recent horror films have been . . . fun . \\n * complimentary movie ticket courtesy of valley cinemas in lodi , ca \\n',\n",
       "  b\"cinema has been around for about a hundred years now . ? \\nit's not my job to recap this century every time i talk about a new film , but i'd like to think that i'm beginning to understand the art more as i watch more films from before my time . \\nrecently , i've seen the films of hitchcock , capra , fellini , godard , kurosawa , chaplin , lang , and many others . \\n ? those men were talented artists , and their films reflect their genius . ? \\nthey are likely to be remembered for . \\n . \\n . \\nwell , quite a while . ? \\ni like this film , too . ? \\nyes , it's a disaster-slash-action movie . ? \\ntrue , its budget is a lot more money than i'll ever see in my lifetime . ? \\nand there's not a doubt in my mind that the only reason it was conceived was to make a lot of money . ? \\nin fact , i bet the producers of armageddon would have worked towards a lousy film , had they thought it would've been more profitable . \\ni certainly don't care what their intentions were , because michael bay ( the rock ) is such a skilled director that i doubt he'd ever make a film that is difficult to sit through . \\nof course , skillful direction doesn't complete the package , but the rest of armageddon manages to keep everything together . \\nthe story is well-thought out ( and perfectly paced to provide for an abundance of action sequences that never feel out of place ) , the acting is terrific , the script is sharp , and -- get this -- there are characters . \\nyes , you read that right . \\narmageddon actually has characters you can care about ! \\nif you don't like this film , then you have a problem with the genre itself : armageddon is as good as a film like this can be . \\nif you've seen deep impact , then you know the basic framework for the story . \\nit turns out that an asteroid the size of texas is going to strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the film . \\nso , it's up to the u . s . government to stop it . \\n ( why the u . s . is always exclusively saddled with these problems is never fully investigated . ) \\ntheir plan -- to send a group of experienced oil drillers up to the asteroid , drill down several hundred feet , and detonate a nuclear warhead within . \\nthe head driller is harry stamper ( bruce willis ) . \\nhis group of men is a colorful bunch , including a . j . \\n ( ben affleck ) , chick ( will patton ) , and rockhound ( steve buscemi ) . \\nthere's also an interesting triangle formed between a . j . , harry , and grace ( liv tyler ) , who is harry's daughter . \\na . j . \\nand grace are , of course , romantically intertwined , and dad isn't too happy with the situation . \\nit's absurd to wish for a complicated story in an event movie or a special effects movie or whatever it is you'd like to call armageddon . \\nit's not about story -- it's about viscera and action , and thrills-a-minute , and all that stuff . \\nit's incidental , really , that the story is cohesive and even remotely believable , because most people will be too wrapped up in the explosions to give two seconds' thought to what actually happens . \\nbut bay is the one to congratulate in this case , for he has made a film so entertaining and so visually sharp that i doubt any director could have done it better . \\ni think most of the budget went to cameras alone , because bay films every action sequence from about thirty or forty different angles . \\ntake the spectacular opening scene , for instance , in which a meteor shower obliterates new york . \\na meteor flies out of the sky and crashes into a building , which sends fireballs erupting into the air and cars spinning like tops upon other cars . \\nthe action itself might take five seconds in real life , but bay edits so quickly that we get the same scene in six different ways . \\ni like his quick-edit style , because it's abrasive and exhausting to watch . \\nit's also very loud , and obnoxiously noisy at times . \\nbut it's fun to be obnoxious sometimes . \\nthe special effects in this film put every other 1998 blockbuster to shame . \\ndeep impact , visually , has absolutely nothing on armageddon , and to offer a comparison between the quality of this film and godzilla is simply laughable . \\nspecial effects are very important in a film like this : if they're not good , then the image is not convincing , and the film doesn't work . \\neverything here looks bright and explosive -- from the little meteors bursting through skyscrapers , all the way to the shots of the earth through the jutting rocks on the ominously approaching asteroid . \\nthe effects that don't look totally real are still a pleasure to behold , and i credit everyone involved for creating the first blockbuster so nice-looking that it actually qualifies as art . \\nof course , all of this would add up to little more than an above-average light show , if i didn't get the feeling that bay cares as much about his characters as he does about his action . \\nthe film is two and a half hours long , and not all of that is spent submerged in numbing action . \\nmuch of the film is dedicated to developing the various characters' subplots . \\ni won't suggest that these are complex characters , but their problems are real , and the emotions aren't put forth in a sentimental and overbearing way . \\nin fact , there are three or four scenes here that had me pretty choked up , and that's a lot more than i can say about deep impact , which was banking on the feel-good parts of its story . \\nbruce willis is terrific , and i'm glad to see him bigger than life again ( recent turns in films like mercury rising have been very disappointing ) . \\ntyler and affleck are great together , and make a convincing couple -- all of the scenes between them work on a comfortable level . \\npatton , who is a magnificent actor , thankfully is not wasted here , and the minor subplot revolving around his ex-wife and son is very moving . \\nthe comic relief from buscemi and peter stormare ( who plays a crazy russian astronaut ) is nifty , and keeps the film lively and funny . \\ni wasn't challenged to think real hard while watching armageddon , and i don't mind too much . \\nbut the film doesn't insult my intelligence -- it's pitched perfectly to entertain , which is what all it really wants to do . \\nit's not mindless and escapist , but well-crafted cinema . \\nit might have been created for the wrong reasons , but men like michael bay have my respect for showing me that they are interested in making something good , in spite of the producers and the budget . \\ni'm not saying that films like this are risky moves . \\nwhat i am saying is that armageddon is a big , loud , expensive motion picture that reminds me that art often comes in the strangest of forms . \\n\",\n",
       "  b'contact is the 1997 movie i\\'ve seen the most - five times to be exact . \\nfour of those times were on the big screen , but even on a tv , it\\'s a very impressive film . \\nthe same can\\'t be said for films like independance day , but that\\'s because contact is a rare example in sci-fi filmmaking where the story is treated more importantly than the special effects , and all of us know looking back that id4 didn\\'t offer much outside of some one-time delightful eye candy . \\ncontact\\'s wonderfully presented story deals with ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) , a radio astronomer whose preference of study involves the outdated technique of \" merely listening \" to sounds out in space . \\nher interest in the field of astronomy developed at a very young age , encouraged by her loving father , ted ( david morse ) , who let ellie use a small ham radio to pick up on frequencies and communicate with people as far away as pensacola , fl ( that was , of course , before the days of internet chat rooms ) . \\nwhile everyone else uses modern technologies to aid them in the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence ( of which the program seti is an acronym for ) , ellie prefers to pop on a pair of headphones and see what she can pick up on , keeping the youthful magic and intrigue strongly alive . \\nellie\\'s strong scientific basis essentially makes her an atheist , a belief likely influenced by the death of her father while she was still quite young . \\nin puerto rico , she meets palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a writer examining the effects of technology on the world\\'s overall happiness ; a one- time seminary student who describes himself as \" a man of the cloth , without the cloth \" . \\ndespite the vast differences in opinion regarding a \" supreme being \" , ellie and palmer hit it off , and even take the time to sleep together . \\nit\\'s a weak and hurried relationship , but director zemeckis needs it to add to the plot later on . \\nmeanwhile , dr . david drumlin ( tom skerritt ) , who has authority over seti but finds the program a frivolous waste of time and money , is ready to pull the plug on any and all seti funding . \\nthis leaves the passionate ellie searching for new sponsors , eventually finding a setup in new mexico and leaving palmer with no explanation , and only a one night stand to remember . \\nit is in this nm city where , several months later , ellie finally picks up on a strong signal from outer space , perhaps the most profound discovery in the history of science . \\nwhen the signal is closely examined , many new developments spring up , and before long , drumlin is stepping in to take over the operation he once scoffed at . \\neventually , it is concluded that information in the signal may be blueprints for a transportation device used to teleport an earthling to vega ( where the signal seems to have originated ) . \\nthe media swarms , fanatics go further off the deep end , scientists clamor for new information , politicians huddle in discussion of appropriate actions to take , and presidents are morphed into a celluloid reality ( remember when zemeckis couldn\\'t get enough of this in forrest gump ? ) . \\nas if that weren\\'t enough , ellie\\'s discovery leads her to the nation\\'s capital where she again runs into palmer . \\ncontact is based on the novel by carl sagan and deals heavily with the subject of science vs . religion . \\nthe impressive thing is how well both aspects are presented , with no signs of bias . \\narguments for both sides are intelligent , solid , and thought-provoking . \\nwhen palmer joins a selection committee to choose an ambassador to vega ( of which ellie is a leading candidate ) , personal convictions play a more important role than love interests . \\nthe question is , can a person who doesn\\'t believe in god truly be the best representative of earth when 90% of the planet * does * believe in a higher power ? \\neven when the film wraps up , it\\'s uncertain whether it\\'s meant to play as an advocate for religion , science , both , or even neither , and in our modern day society where \" right and wrong \" is only opinion ( at least speaking \" politically correctly \" ) , the ambiguity is an incentive . \\ndon\\'t get me wrong . \\nas much as it sounds like it , contact isn\\'t merely a theology class rolled into a reel of film . \\nit\\'s a * highly * enjoyable two and a half hours . \\ndespite its seemingly heavy issues , it\\'s not a tedious undertaking to watch this film . \\nthe special effects are outstanding , though ( warning ! ) \\nhighly depreciated on the small screen . \\neven so , some of the subtle visual effects ( that will likely go unnoticed by many ) are even more impressive than ones more recognizable as \" sci-fi \" . \\nthe storytelling is rich and complete , and although there are moments in the film that feel quite pretentious ( and at times , even hokey ) , it\\'s easily one of the best 1997 films , and one of the best sci-fi films i\\'ve ever seen . \\nthis is zemeckis\\' best since back to the future , and for those of us who actually know that forrest gump was astronomically overrated , zemeckis now has real reason to boast . \\n',\n",

       "  b'when i was growing up in 1970s , boys in my school used to divide into two groups , based on their action movies preferences . \\nthe first one , myself included , liked movies that featured spectacular car chases , lots of machinegun fire and huge explosions . \\nthe latter one preferred hong kong martial arts flicks , probably because they could ( or , to be more precise , thought they could ) imitate its stunts in the real life . \\ndecades later , while refining my own cinematic taste , i began to appreciate and actually like those movies , probably because of overexposure to shoot-em-up idiocy of 1980s ramboids . \\nyes , most of the kung fu and other \" martial arts \" flicks were cheap , they had predictable and formulaic plot , and asked very little of production values aside from martial arts skills . \\nbut , in the same time , those movies had their own rules and in the hands of capable director could become a terrific guilty pleasure and source of relaxation . \\nthe best of those movies , one that passed the test of time and managed to keep its own cult status after quarter of century was enter the dragon . \\nmade in 1973 in a joint hong kong - hollywood venture , it was intended to bring bruce lee\\'s skills and kung fu philosophy to the western audience . \\nit succeeded , but it is still debatable whether by its own merit or by the unfortunate and mysterious death of bruce lee that immortalised the myth about that actor . \\nlee plays a quiet shaolin monk who is a martial arts expert . \\nhe is approached by interpol official who asks him to join tri-annual martial arts tournament that is held on a remote island , owned and controlled by han , renegade shaolin monk . \\ninterpol suspects that the martial arts business is just cover for narcotics , gun-running and prostitution operations and lee must find the evidence necessary for authorities to intervene . \\nlee accepts the mission because of personal reasons - o\\'harra , han\\'s brutal bodyguard was responsible for the tragic death of lee\\'s sister years ago . \\nthe island is also destination of two colourful martial arts experts from us - williams ( played by jim kelly ) is black activist running from the racist police , and his friend roper wants to make money in order to pay gambling debts . \\nthe plot of enter the dragon was in many ways influenced by james bond ( the 007 franchise itself would return favour by using kung fu elements in the man with the golden gun two years later ) . \\nthe main hero was faced against a power-hungry megalomaniac on a remote island , alone against whole army of bad guys . \\non the other hand , lee was more believable hero than bond ; deprived of guns and super-tech gadgets , he had to rely only on his personal skills in order to survive . \\nin the same time , the plot , although extremely thin , allowed him even some internal battles - between the natural instinct to avenge his sister and his own anti-violent philosophy . \\nthe latter provided some opportunities to evaluate lee\\'s acting skills and some new elements to his impressive screen presence . \\nalthough two other main actors - john saxon being the obligatory good white guy and jim kelly being the obligatory black good guy - were intended to share top spot with lee , they served as nothing more than a comic relief . \\nit is a real shame to see kelly , definitely the worse actor than saxon , to steal the scenes from him only because his lines , being the worst possible blaxploitation cliches , sound so damn over the top . \\nother actors , not including shih kien who turns han into typical , although not very convincing bondian villain , are nothing more than fist fodder for bruce lee ( among them is young jackie chan ) . \\nfighting scenes are still impressive today as they were 25 years ago , although they mostly lack gore associated with that genre . \\nin many way they are also more realistic ( they were personally staged by lee himself ) , demanding only a blow or two to incapacitate or kill the opponent . \\ni\\'m not a martial arts expert nor the martial arts fan , but comparing those scenes with typical scenes today i simply can\\'t avoid to appreciate the difference from today\\'s movie fights when masses of bloody pulp manage to get up from the floor and win in the end . \\nso , despite all the obvious flaws that preclude this movie of being top 100 of all times , enter the dragon is a incredibly entertaining piece of cinema and the martial arts flick that can be enjoyed even by those who don\\'t like that particular genre . \\n',\n",

       "  b'there\\'s no reason to doubt that donnie brasco is based , as its opening credits proclaim , on a true story . \\nbut if it\\'s an accurate picture of life on america\\'s mean streets , than cinematic depictions of organised crime have had a much stronger basis in reality than i would have previously thought . \\nfor from the film\\'s outset , when a group of hoods jocularly trade differing opinions on the merits of various automobiles ( not unlike a number of movie lowlifes who recently gave a madonna song a close reading ) donnie brasco resembles more than passingly a few gangster flicks once believed to be works of fiction . \\nour eponymous hero ( johnny depp ) is not the cheap crook he first appears to be . \\nbrasco is joseph pistone , an undercover fbi agent who has the task of chumming-up to lefty ( al pacino ) , a seasoned hood who tutors pistone in the art of being a \" wiseguy \" . \\nregrettably , pistone learns his lessons all too well . \\nhis concern for lefty , who is burdened with a heroin addicted son , exacerbates his own family troubles : his children resent his lengthy absences and his wife fears that her husband\\'s gangster persona is becoming a little too convincing . \\ntrue , the focus on pistone\\'s family life does deviate from the typical gangster-flick formula , but this subplot never rises above its television drama origins . \\nthe unhappy couple trade predictable lines and engage in drawn-out domestic squabbles ? including an ill-advised marriage guidance routine ? that slow the film down unnecessarily . \\nthe biggest problem with donnie brasco , however , is that its wiseguy attitude and style lacks the flair of its many predecessors . \\nthe awkward use of an occasional disco tune momentarily reminds us its the 70\\'s , but not with the consistent and blindingly tacky style ? i loved those fluoro coloured suits ? of scorces\\' costume drama casino . \\nmore importantly , pacino\\'s presence triggers memories of his earlier movie triumphs in which similar territory was covered far more effectively . \\ndonnie brasco\\'s take on american values , for instance , is feeble and obvious . \\nlefty rambles out dreams of material betterment to the accompaniment of grating inspirational music . \\ninexplicably , lefty\\'s horatio alger inspired gush is supposed to move us . \\nit doesn\\'t any more than his family troubles do , which are dealt in the same saccharine and obvious manner as pistone\\'s . \\njust think a minute on how these themes were explored in the godfather movies and scarface . \\nin these pictures pacino\\'s dedication to a peculiar and bloody hyper-capitalism was twisted and confronting , while his dogged application of macho wiseguy procedure meant that his relations to friends and family was intriguingly dark ? neither were spared bloody retribution for breaching wiseguy regulations . \\ndonnie brasco\\'s tawdry little crime , therefore isn\\'t so much its repetition of familiar gangster themes , but the shameless way in which it sanitises them . \\n ( oh and by the way , i forgot to mention that the script also sports a startling subplot : pipstone\\'s superiors are obstructive incompetents who are infuriated by his constant insubordination ? is that a \" damn you mcbain ! \" \\ni hear from springfield way ? ) \\nso the movie is cliched . \\nbig deal , what do you expect from a gangster-flick ? \\nwell you expect quality action sequences and bravado performances in abundance if its going to be a decent example of the genre . \\ndonnie brasco fails on both counts . \\nthe action scenes never rise above the ordinary and depp\\'s woeful performance tends to smother the good-work of his comrades . \\nadmittedly , pacino does nothing new and michael madsen ( sonny ) simply smirks his way through the picture like a slightly subdued mr . white , but both possess an unmistakable sly charm . \\ndepp usually exhibits a bit of class himself , but regrettably , being in the presence of one of his betters must have left him star-struck , for he is completely hell-bent on mimicking pacino\\'s well-earned high style . \\nthe consequences are painful to watch . \\nits no exaggeration to say that the film\\'s credibility is seriously strained by the sight of the pistone family\\'s uncanny ability to keep a straight face in front of their breadwinner\\'s phony brooklyn accent . \\nperhaps we should take pity on the makers of donnie brasco . \\nmaybe a scrupulous adherence to pinpoint accuracy demanded tiered dialogue and scenarios weakly reminiscent of classic gangster flicks . \\nif this is indeed the case , surely the makers of donnie brasco could have explored the fascinating possibility that america\\'s underworld is committed to emulating , albeit in heavily attenuated form , their movie namesakes . \\ndepp could have poignantly played a simple cop who becomes a hideous parody once he is forced to mimic big-screen gangster greats . \\nwho knows what insights into the criminal psyche could have arisen ? \\nbut then again , perhaps donnie brasco isn\\'t so true after all . \\n',\n",

\\nand how is it that the fellow that screws over all of his buddies is able to round up exactly five friends to complete the number of people required to enter the realm at exactly the same time ? \\ni can barely get more than two together all at once at any given moment . \\nthe most ridiculous segment though comes right before the aforementioned dragging/salting sequence . \\nthe character in question , dana ( angela zimmely ) , has her turn up to be killed and is standing at the front of a movie theater in which the presence is seated . \\na priest holding two naked dirty humans on leashes walks in and sits down next to a large platter of fried chicken . \\nhe picks up the entire platter and starts to enjoy the chicken , taunting dana as she looks on with no interest whatsoever . \\nwhen she starts to leave , the priest chides her for going before the performance starts and then something that looks like a either a creature from a gwar show or a terry gilliam animation from monty python come to life , walks out , and makes like it wants to be crucified by her . \\nthe presence starts to clap annoyingly ( which continues for the rest of the sequence ) until dana takes off with the strange creature following her . \\nwhen it finally catches up to her , she stabs it in its giant eyeball and is covered in slimy glop that spurts from the ruptured organ . \\nthe box for the film claims \" because of the horrifying nature of the motion picture , parental discretion is advised for persons under the age of 18 . \\ncontains nudity and graphic violence \" . \\nwhile both is certainly true , there doesn\\'t seem to be much of either in any large amounts . \\nbesides a loving close up of a spurting neck stump , a semi-graphic self-surgery scene , and two instances of head trauma ( one run over and one melting ) , most of the gore is just of the spraying blood or bloody wound covered body variety . \\nas for nudity , it is very sparse , but at least we get to see angela zimmerly ( far and away the most attractive cast member ) before her body is bruised , torn , and bloodied by the dragging incident . \\nice from the sun has been released on vhs by www . b-movie . com . \\nit has been presented in in full-frame only and the transfer ( for a film shot a good deal in 8mm ) is pretty decent . \\nbesides the decent soundtrack ( which is also available from www . b-movie . com ) , a making-of video is also available called on thin ice . \\ni haven\\'t had the opportunity to see the documentary , but i actually would have been interested to see what the set was like while all of the shots were being filmed , if only to see how director eric stanze ( director of a similar cult film called savage harvest ) , conducted the atmosphere on set . \\n',\n",

       "  b'if i were one of those arrogant critics who thinks his review has some great impact on the success or failure of certain films , i might say that i review movies that don\\'t look particularly good because i\\'m doing a service to my readers by warning them against seeing it . \\nif that were true , i could put a banner at the top of my site that reads : \" shay casey : seeing bad movies so you don\\'t have to . \" \\nbut i know that\\'s bunk-you\\'re going to see whatever movies you want to no matter what i say . \\nso i have to tell the truth : every once in a while i get a nasty , masochistic urge to see a bad movie . \\nyou know the feeling , when you\\'re sick of seeing all these damn academy award contenders and you want to see something you can have a ball trashing mercilessly . \\nsometimes i think that\\'s why anyone goes to see pauly shore movies , ever . \\nadmit it : sometimes you like seeing bad movies . \\nso do i . \\nso i saw \" supernova . \" \\ntruth be told , \" supernova \" wasn\\'t quite as bad as i thought it might be . \\nmaybe i just felt sorry for the actors , or maybe i thought it could have been decent if the studio hadn\\'t started tinkering with the director\\'s ( walter hill ) final cut , causing him to want his name removed . \\nmaybe i\\'m becoming a softy . \\nin any case , i didn\\'t find \" supernova \" as bad as the advance buzz would have me believe . \\nbut it\\'s still bad . \\nthe film takes place aboard the medical space vessel \" nightingale . \" \\nthe crew includes captain a . j . \\nmarley ( robert forster ) , his new second officer nick vanzant ( james spader ) , head medical officer kaela evers ( angela bassett ) , medical technicians yerzy penalosa ( lou diamond phillips ) and danika lund ( robin tunney ) , and computer technician benj sotomejor ( wilson cruz ) . \\nthere are some attempts at \" characterization , \" but all that means is that nick has a shady past involving a drug addiction , which puts kaela on edge , yerzy and danika have a relationship that requires them to make kissy-faces at each other every five minutes , and benj ( apparently gay ) is in love with the computer ( apparently female ) . \\ndon\\'t expect any more explanation , because you won\\'t get it . \\nanyway , the crew gets a distress call from a location deep in space to which a failed mining operation had been sent . \\nduring the dimension jump ( i think that\\'s what it\\'s called , but don\\'t hold me to it ) , the captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal ( peter facinelli ) is brought on board . \\nhe calls himself troy larson , making him the supposed son of a man kaela once had a relationship with . \\nthen a bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening . \\nhave you seen \" alien ? \" \\nhave you seen \" event horizon \" ( a lame movie in its own right ) ? \\ngood . \\nthen you\\'ve seen \" supernova . \" \\npost-production cuts or not , there is nothing original about this screenplay , and nothing unpredictable either . \\nafter all , no one\\'s going to think for a second that troy won\\'t turn out to be a villain . \\nbut the bigger problem with \" supernova \" is that it can\\' t just stick to the simple plot it\\'s afforded . \\nnumerous re-writes ( the script may be credited to three people , but it\\'s a gross underestimate ) have crammed this lean 90-minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped . \\nwas there something about a limping robot shaped like a fighter pilot ? \\ndid the ship\\'s computer learn something about humanity ? \\nwhat was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him ? \\nand just what does the film\\'s title signify , if anything ? \\nas far as i can tell , it refers to a very small plot detail that isn\\'t developed , just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements . \\ncharacter relationships in this film also make very little sense . \\nfor some reason , every person in this film keeps having sex . \\nwe get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first 10 minutes . \\nbassett and spader\\'s characters start off hating each other . \\nfifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later , they\\'re engaging in some hanky-panky . \\nwhen troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship , of course both female crew members will fall in love with him . \\nevery single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly , which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut . \\nthe most prominent example , however , may be the fact that when the film starts , there are no opening credits ! \\nfurthermore , the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits . \\nmaybe that\\'s why the film\\'s title is mentioned twice during the end credits , right between james spader and robert forster . \\nright after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you\\'re seeing ( lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery ) , you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of a scene , with little-to-no introduction to any of the characters or situations . \\nthe rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes ( you know , where they explain things ) and just went from point a to point b . point a : danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready to have his baby . \\npoint b : tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing . \\ndoesn\\'t make sense . \\nsince i didn\\'t understand anything about these characters\\' motivations , did i care when troy abruptly starts murdering them one-by-one ( and he does , knocking off three of them in about 10 minutes ) ? \\nnot a whit . \\nit\\'s a shame , because this cast contains a lot of talented actors looking for something to do . \\nthey don\\'t find it . \\nbassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces . \\nsexual tension ? \\nmore like constipation . \\nmaybe they\\'re just embarrassed at having to utter such howlers as \" this thing was made by someone more powerful than god and a whole lot less nice . \" \\nnot that we ever find out who that is , mind you . \\nthe climax of their relationship ( taking place in a transport pod ) is probably the film\\'s biggest forehead-slapper . \\nas troy , peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected . \\nhe\\' s awfully one-note , but it\\'s not as if he\\'s given any more notes to work with . \\nthe rest of the cast does even less . \\ntunney stands around looking cute , then scared . \\nphillips broods . \\ncruz flirts with the computer . \\nthen they all die and a star blows up or something , but i really wasn\\'t paying much attention by then . \\n \" supernova \" is pretty awful , but i\\'m cutting it a little slack merely because i expected less than what i got . \\nthat\\'s it . \\nif you expect it to be good ( for whatever reasons you may have ) , you\\'ll probably hate it more than i will . \\neven the special effects are fairly unimpressive , nothing you haven\\' t seen before , and suffice to say the script isn\\'t going to save the film . \\nhonestly , though , what do you expect from a film with about a dozen writers and a director who had his name removed and replaced with a pseudonym ? \\nit usually results in a bad movie , and that\\'s what \" supernova \" is . \\n',\n",
       "  b'synopsis : captain picard and the crew of the starship enterprise disobey federation orders and defend a peaceful community of 600 , the ba\\'ku , from the evil admiral dougherty and ru\\'afro . \\nthe enterprise crew , in the meantime , experience the rejuvenating qualities of the ba\\'ku homeworld : lt . worf grows a pimple , data sings opera pieces , picard scores with a ba\\'ku chick , riker shaves while sharing a bubblebath with troi , and the enterprise women note their firmer breasts . \\ncomments : \" star trek : the next generation \" was a hugely successful sequel tv series to \" star trek , \" a science fiction series which developed a devoted fan following in the 1970s . \\neven though it still enjoyed high ratings , \" star trek : the next generation \" ended production after seven years so that the cast could replace the original \" star trek \" \\'s cast in paramount\\'s film franchise centering on the voyages of the starship enterprise . \\nstar trek : insurrection is the ninth \" star trek \" movie and the third to focus on the \" star trek : the next generation \" crew . \\nstar trek : insurrection qualifies as one of those movies star trek fans , such as myself , would rate somewhere between \" okay \" and \" good . \" \\nafter star trek v : the final frontier , a nearly awful movie almost as bad as the repugnant \" star trek : voyager \" tv series , \" star trek \" fans could probably swallow anything paramount throws out in the trek film franchise . \\ni don\\'t wish to spend this review comparing insurrection to the eight other trek movies . \\nmost people reading this probably haven\\'t followed \" star trek \" anyway , so a comparison would seem tedious at best . \\nlet me , thus , make my comparisons briefly so that it\\'s out of my system : star trek : insurrection is not as good as the previous installment , star trek : first contact ; star trek : insurrection\\'s comic tone may be best compared to star trek iv : the voyage home ; star trek ii : the wrath of khan is still the best trek movie . \\nokay . let\\'s move to the movie itself . \\nstar trek : insurrection infuses a basic science fiction premise , humanity\\'s exploration and colonization of space , with a lot of lowbrow humor and witty oneliners . \\nthis combination works well more often than it fails , but when it does fail , the humor really seems cheesy . \\nmuch of this film appeals to trek fans\\' nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprise\\'s crew . \\naudiences unfamiliar with trek lore may miss the significance of some plot points and may even become confused at times . \\nstar trek : insurrection begins with scenes of the tranquil life on the ba\\'ku homeworld . \\nforget the actors and special effects , the beautiful setting of this movie , with its snowy mountaintops and verdant valleys , steals the show . \\nthis tranquility , however , is broken by data , an android , who reveals to the ba\\'ku that they are being secretly monitored by the federation and their alien allies , the son\\'a . \\nit seems that this world is a veritable fountain of youth , sustaining its inhabitants indefinantly in a young , healthy state . \\nthe enterprise crew , led by captain picard , investigates data\\'s actions and uncovers a conspiracy between the son\\'a and an enterprise admiral to relocate the ba\\'ku and plunder the planet\\'s youth-restoring properties . \\nsound pretty heavy ? \\nit is , though this plot , anything but unique and groundbreaking , is undermined by the film\\'s constant barrage of humor . \\nwhen going after data , for instance , picard sings an opera piece with him ( this is supposed to be cute and humorous ) . \\nin a much more funny sequence , work grows a large pimple on the side of his nose as a result of his exposure to the ba\\'ku homeworld , a pimple which his crewmates , try as they might , cannot avoid looking at . \\nthe acting in star trek : insurrection is , for the most part , pretty good . \\nsince they\\'ve been playing these characters for years , those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough . \\nthe terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jean-luc picard and delivers a moral speech , picard\\'s trademark , with his usual aplomb . \\nbrent spiner , another fine actor , plays the android data well enough again and provides the best moments of comic relief in the film ( though the old android-wishing-to-be-human motif will tire some trek fans familiar with the routine from the tv series ) . \\nthe supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good . \\ndespite many other critics\\' negative opinions , f . murray abraham ( the winner of an academy award for his performance in amadeus ) plays the major villain ru\\'afro well enough . \\nru\\'afro reminds me , somewhat , of the baron harkonnen in the 1984 film version of dune . \\nlike the baron , ru\\'afro continuously has his skin looked after : it is stretched and stapled by servants . \\nin one particularly memorable scene , ru\\'afro becomes very agitated , and his facial skin splits open and bleeds . \\nru\\'afro is no khan from star trek ii--the best trek villain ever--but he is much better than the forgettable dr . soran from star trek : generations . \\n ( okay , i promise , no more comparisons . ) \\ndonna murphy must also be noted as a ba\\'ku woman , anij , who picard falls in love with . \\nmurphy is not a young woman with a supermodel body ; she is a mature woman with an attractive countenance . \\nthis is the type of woman whom picard , for those who know the character well , would be enchanted with . \\nin fact , the chemistry between murphy and stewart works very well here . \\na particular plot point involving anij\\'s ability to slow time down , an ability which she shares with picard , becomes one of the most intriguing parts of the movie . \\nfor as good as the actors and setting were , star trek : insurrection\\'s special effects were surprisingly disappointing . \\nthey proved adequate , sometimes barely , for a 1990s mainstream science fiction film , but they fell way short of the standard trek movie and paled in comparison to those seen in the trailer for star wars : the phantom menace ( a trailer which reportedly preceded many showings of insurrection ) . \\nthe space battles involving the enterprise and sona ships , in particular , seemed trite and unsuspenseful , and the final confrontation between picard and ru\\'afro took place on a completely unconvincing interior of a satellite . \\nthe new enterprise itself , only seen in this film and its predecessor , remains largely unexplored , though its exterior doesn\\'t look quite right for a reason i cannot explain . \\ndespite star trek : insurrection\\'s frequent comic goofiness and occasional substandard special effects , i enjoyed the film . \\nit maintains roddenberry\\'s largely optimistic view of the future and rejects the gritty violence of its predecessors , particularly star trek : first contact ( though , don\\'t get me wrong , the dark tones of trek films like first contact can work very successfully ) . \\ni\\'d recommend insurrection as a matinee film for a saturday afternoon , especially for fans of trek or science fiction in general . \\nrated pg , i can\\'t see this film being objectionable to the viewing audience , young or old . \\n',\n",
       "  b'one of the more unusual and suggestively violent films ever made , \" se7en \" is just a few steps away from brilliance . \\nhowever , those few steps away are only a few steps from a level of evil and depravity that few people want to discuss . \\nthe film received mixed reviews upon release , but there\\'s an underlying sinister appeal and intrigue to this that many critics perhaps did not notice . \\nat times it gets preachy about the horrors it seems to be criticizing , but the script and the ultimate pay-off are excellent . \\nthe shocking conclusion is just as unpredictable as the endings of most films are predictable . \\nthis piece of work is 100% intensity . \\nit\\'s uncomfortable to watch , yet compelling . \\n \" i want not to look , yet i cannot turn away . \" \\nthe story creeps along slowly and deliberately , crafted by visionary director david fincher . \\nhe has experience in tantalizing his audience with information and visions , but not giving away too much too soon . \\nthis is the guy who directed the ominous \" alien 3 \" . \\n \" se7en \" is even more ominous because the threat is real . \\nit\\'s human and , while the script takes some artistic licence , the way in which the diabolical killer works here is actually realistic . \\nthat is , if a human being could be so intelligent , patient , wealthy , and disillusioned . \\nafter the most bizarre opening credits i\\'ve ever seen ( refreshingly different in editing style and musical accompaniment ) , the initial character development takes place . \\nmorgan freeman stars as detective william somerset , a knowledgeable veteran who is ready to give up on his job and the sickness of society . \\nbrad pitt co-stars as detective david mills , the young hotshot who is brand new to this unnamed city and full of fury to catch the bad guys . \\nthese two fine actors give the film its human qualities ( along with the appealing gwyneth paltrow , who plays tracy , mills\\' wife ) . \\nhowever , none of them stands out above the material . \\nno disrespect intended , but two other actors could have played these parts and the film probably would have been about the same . \\nan ironic note is that somerset has only a week ( or 7 , that\\'s seven , days ) left on the force to train his young protege . \\nthe title of the picture also refers to the 7 deadly sins , as chronicled by john milton in \" paradise lost \" --gluttony , greed , sloth , lust , pride , envy , & wrath . \\nincidentally , i wrote the sins in order of how each victim was found . \\nit\\'s the last two sins that are the most intriguing and shocking , but i won\\'t give that away . \\nas i said , this has a great ending and no one should spoil it . \\nanyway , the brilliant killer sets out to make a statement to the world that these sins will no longer be tolerated and he makes the \" sinners \" suffer for it . \\nthe two partners stumble over the corpse of a grotesquely obese man . \\nthey learn that he was murdered--forced to eat himself to death . \\nthe killer leaves small clues at this and other murders and , of course , somerset and mills are smart enough to stay with him all the way . \\nif they didn\\'t , it would be one short movie ! \\nthe deliberate pace allows for craftsmanship of detail and story . \\nwe see a lot of blood , but it\\'s not especially violent . \\nthe suggestion of what happens is far more disgusting than anything actually shown--like most of the violence in \" pulp fiction \" . \\n \" se7en \" is gory , graphic , and disturbing , but all the gore is post-death . \\nstill , if you tend to get queasy , don\\'t eat food during this film . \\nkevin spacey plays john doe , the avenging angel who claims that he\\'s the messenger who will right the wrongs with his teachings . \\nlike many crazy men , he has some fine ideas , but some sick ways of expressing himself . \\nspacey doesn\\'t appear until the final 30 minutes and also doesn\\'t receive billing in the opening credits . \\nhowever , it\\'s his appearance that turns this film upside down and for that he should have gotten an oscar nomination . \\na great villain manages to make you either root for him or feel compelled to listen to his ramblings regardless of whether you agree with him or not . \\nthis character is so well written that it\\'s hard to disagree when he says that what he is doing will be remembered by everyone . \\nno serial killer has ever been so creative . \\n \" se7en \" is blatantly unsubtle with its messages about the horrors of the world and it\\'s often a little too depressing . \\nwhat it lacks in those areas , it makes up for with believable dialogue , top-notch screenwriting , unexpected twists , and realistic characters . \\nthe technical aspects of the film are unobtrusive . \\nfincher uses lighting , music , and editing quite well , but his story is always the thrust of the film . \\nfortunately , we don\\'t find out what happens to mills and somerset after the closing credits ( which are run backwards up the screen ! ) . \\nit\\'s better to imagine what paths they will follow . \\nthis is not the kind of film you turn away from and quickly forget . \\nit\\'s got a sinister message and john doe is right about one thing--the evils of the world aren\\'t going to cure themselves . \\n \" se7en \" raises some tough questions and it\\'s intelligent enough to allow its audience to answer many of those questions for themselves . \\nuseless trivia--co-stars in 1995\\'s \" se7en \" , brad pitt and kevin spacey also competed for the 1995 best supporting actor oscar--pitt in \" 12 monkeys \" , spacey in \" the usual suspects \" ( for which he won ) . \\n',\n",
       "  b'when i first heard that disney\\'s next animated feature was going to be tarzan , i was almost horrified . \\ni was worried that disney was going to make another hercules ( sorry , jerk-ules ) . \\nthat effort was too overloaded with comedy ( and the hero was too boastful and pompous to be considered a sympathetic hero ) , and , after viewing it to this day , i find it a disgrace for disney animation . \\nwhen i saw the trailers , i was thinking \" hmm . . . \\nthis isn\\'t bad at all . \\nthis just might have potential . \" \\nwhen i bought the soundtrack , i was really quite surprised at how different it sounded from most disney features . \\ni have never really heard of phil collins , nor have i heard of mark mancina , so i was wondering , how would these two make this disney flick spin ? \\ni was pleasantly surprised : the music is top-notch . \\nphil collins\\' songs are terrific , percussion-heavy pieces of work that seem to break the formula for typical disney songs . \\nthe score from mark mancina was also neat ; it reminded me a bit of the lion king , but it was more original . \\nso , the soundtrack wasn\\'t bad at all , considering it was by two people i am not familiar with . \\nthis film could be good . . . \\nbut will it be ? \\nwhen i finally went to see it ( on opening day , as i tend to do with most disney animated features ) , my question was answered , in a complete turnabout of expectations for me : disney\\'s tarzan is surprisingly decent . \\nthe story starts out with tarzan\\'s parents surviving a shipwreck and finding a home on an island where apes live in peace . \\nhowever , one day , a vicious leopard , sabor , attacks and kills tarzan\\'s parents , leaving him ( at this time , a baby ) alone-until kala of the apes rescues him . \\nkala wants to raise the child as her own ( she lost hers previously to sabor ) , but her mate , kerchak is not too sure . \\n \" it\\'s not our kind , \" he says . \\nhe agrees , though , to let her take care of little tarzan , but \" that doesn\\'t make him my son . \" \\ntarzan grows up , vowing to be \" the best ape ever \" , but no matter how hard he tries or what he does ( at the guidance of his hilarious ape friend , terk ) , he just can\\'t convince kerchak that he is one of the apes , even when he defeats sabor in a battle . \\none day , a new animal shows up : humans . \\nthis is where jane comes into the picture . \\nshe is on an expedition with her father ( professor porter ) , and a despicable hunter ( clayton ) searching for gorillas . \\ntarzan rescues her when she is chased by baboons , and soon they get to know each other . \\neven though tarzan falls in love with jane , this causes things to go wrong . \\nclayton tricks tarzan into taking him , jane , and porter to see the apes , who are convinced that he has betrayed them . \\nworse , clayton has plotted to send the gorillas to london for money . \\nwill tarzan find out which family he belongs to and save the apes ? \\ni\\'m not gonna tell you , sorry . \\nyou\\'re gonna have to see for yourself . \\nand see it you should ; the animation is , as always , top notch , particularly when tarzan goes soaring through the trees ( read that , skateboarding ) . \\nthe deep canvas computer generated effect adds an authentic feeling to the jungle which tarzan lives in . \\nin fact , it seems similar to the computer imagery/cel animation combination in rival disney animted films , such as fox\\'s anastasia and dreamworks\\' prince of egypt . \\ncould it be that disney was actually taking ideas from their rivals ? \\nthe casting is fairly good . \\ntony goldwyn is emotionally believeable as tarzan ( and to my relief , the animators have succeeded in not making him another hercules . \\nnicely done ) , and glenn close is wonderful as kala ( she has a beautiful singing voice , too , by the way ) . \\nlance henrikson as kerchak somewhat reminds me of robby benson\\'s beast voice , which makes him all the more ferocious and gripping . \\nminnie driver had me a little worried at first as the voice of jane . \\ni thought she had the most annoying voice in the whole film ( when i first saw the trailers ) , but when i saw the film , i didn\\'t have a problem with her . \\ni take back my insult on driver . \\nit\\'s nice to hear nigel hawthorne do another voice for a disney animated feature ( he was fflewdurr flamm in disney\\'s most underrated classic , the black cauldron ) ; he is funny and delightful as professor porter . \\non the villiany side of the voices , brian blessed ( the guy who did boss nass in star wars : episode i-the phantom menace ) brings a pompous , and later on vicious , voice to the sinister clayton . \\nhe might not be the strongest character in the film ( he\\'s just a plain bad guy , nothing else ) , but blessed\\'s vocal work contributes greatly . \\nbut if there is any voice that i think steals the whole show , it should be rosie o\\'donnell , who is hilariously funny as terk . \\nshe also has a fiesty attitude ( \" i\\'m gonna kill ya ! \" \\nshe says , more than once ) . \\ni almost sung along with her during one of the film\\'s best moments , where the apes make a mess of the human\\'s camp , via song , er , scatting \" shoo-be-doo , da-be-dah \" . \\ni can see why she wanted to have a rock song for the film , she\\'s a good singer . \\nnot that she was the only funny character in the film , though . \\nwayne knight ( who played stan in space jam ) gives a whimsically funny style to tantor , an elephant who is especially worried about stepping into \" un-sanitary \" water . \\n ( thankfully , there is no real sound of flatuence-that would have killed the picture ) . \\nthe songs , as i said before , are decent , mostly sung by collins . \\nthis sets a new standard for disney animated films because for the first time , the characters do not sing . \\ni tolerate musical numbers from characters a lot more than some other guys would , but i found this to be a nice change of pace . \\nthe story does have elements of comedy in it , but they also load it with strong dramatic touches , which makes this film far better than the unbelieveably uninspired hercules . \\nif there is anything disappointing about tarzan , it might be the omission of the \\'n sync version of \" trashing the camp \" from the film . \\ni heard it on the soundtrack , and wondered where it was going to be . \\ni was upset that it wasn\\'t , because i had thought of taking a few friends of mine who like \\'n sync to see tarzan . \\noh , well . . . \\noverall , i was enthralled with tarzan . \\ni wouldn\\'t hold it high the way i do with mulan or the hunchback of notre dame ( my all-time favorite disney classics ) , but this film deserves a high place among disney\\'s greatest achievements . \\ni give a nod to disney for following up their spectacular * * * * * masterpiece , mulan , with this great animated adaption of egar rice burrough\\'s tarzan . \\n',\n",
       "  b'if you had a chance to create a genetically perfect child , would you do it ? \\n \" gattaca \" is a film which presents a future where society has answered \" yes \" to this question , but then ponders if this was actually the right decision . \\n \" gattaca \" came out only a couple months following the first genetically engineered creature , the lovable dolly the sheep , and with this in mind , the film only becomes more frightening . \\nthe way the realm of genetics is heading , it may only take a couple decades until the future \" gattaca \" presents becomes true . \\ncontrary to the misleading trailers , \" gattaca \" is not a sci-fi thriller , in the way that there\\'s lots of murder , hitchcockian suspense , and chase scenes . \\nthis is a quiet , sad film about intelligent theories . \\nin fact , the film seems like it would have been written by george orwell or aldous huxley ( the latter who\\'s novel \" brave new world \" featured genetically engineered children ) . \\nit\\'s a film that may likely become a cult hit to people who are frightened by a promise of shallow utopia , which is exactly what \" gattaca \" presents . . . and the main reason i dug it so much . \\nthe story revolves around the genetically insufficient vincent freeman ( ethan hawke ) , a man with high hopes but a 90% chance of heart problems , and a prospected life span of around 30 years . \\nas a child , he was put down because of the threats of genetics , while his younger genetically perfect brother , anton ( loren dean ) , was promised whatever his heart desired . \\nvincent yearns to be an astronaut , but when he gets a job at a giant space company , it\\'s as a janitor ( ernest borgnine plays his boss ! ) . \\nbut one day , he finds out that it\\'s probably possible that his desires can come true in the form of a business deal brought out by a black market geneticist ( or something ) , german ( \" wings \" \\' tony shalhoub , who did like hundreds of cameos in films back in \\'97 : \" men in black , \" \" a life less ordinary \" . . . ) , who\\'s client is a genetically perfect man , jerome morrow ( jude law ) , who has unfortunately been crippled . \\nfortunately , though , there\\'s no record of the accident , and he\\'s willing to give someone else his life . \\nsince vincent looks a bit like him . . . \\nafter a couple alterations ( some minor , some really major ) , he has donned the life of jerome , and is doing his job . \\nthere , he meets a genetically imperfect woman , irene ( uma thurman , who\\'s genetically perfect in real life anyway , hee hee ) , and the two begin a kind of relationship , albeit a very shallow one since romance is deemed by how great a man\\'s stats are . \\nhowever , a murder of a high-level worker at his office is killed , and one of vincent/jerome\\'s eyelashes is found by the anal retentive investigators headed by a semi-wily inspector , hugo , ( alan arkin ) , and none other than vincent\\'s long lost brother , anton , who hasn\\'t seen him since they were teenagers . \\nwe know vincent/jerome didn\\'t do it , but with his older picture being posted everywhere , not only vincent/jerome\\'s in trouble , but also the real jerome , who\\'s as much in it as he is . \\nhowever , there isn\\'t many big suspense set pieces , which is actually a blessing because if they were tossed in , the film would lose it\\'s message and descend into just being a sci-fi thriller a la william gibson . \\nthe suspense in the film comes from the idea that vincent and jerome can easily be captured just by dropping a hair or dead skin . \\nwhile there are several scenes which are pretty frightening , there are no big distractions from the point of the film , much to the dismay of commercial audiences . \\nwhat is actually portrayed is the lack of life in the utopian society that is created . \\nirene has no real spunk in her life , and is rather amazed by the sheer beauty of a sunrise rather than genetically perfect people . \\nand the genetically flawless jerome is in actuality a bitter man , claiming that his accident was really no accident . \\nwhat jerome has done is fool the system in giving a man who yearns for better things a chance at that , and the ending is shocking as it\\'s a definite work of dystopian propaganda , but doesn\\'t have the down ending of other works of this kind . \\nthe production design of this film is probably the best i\\'ve seen this year : it\\'s stunning , very pleasing to the eye , but still very cold . \\nsince genetics has ruled out any chance of improvement , the world has cooled into a state of inhumanity , and the sets echo a sense of shallow misery . \\nand the sequence of all the high-level workers doing their jobs has a kind of gilliam-esque feel to it , showing the nightmare of slipping into a routine zombie-like life . \\nthe ability to perfect people has left humanity cold and generally unhappy . \\nthe acting from everyone is great , with thurman giving a wonderfully cold performance , and hawke creating a character who has been beaten down by the system but has found a new sense of optimism by a bitter man who was willing to give it out anyway ( interesting pointless fact : uma and ethan started dating after this film , and currently she is pregnant with his child ) . \\nbut the best performance belongs to jude law , who steals every scene he\\'s in , and creates a character filled with the pessimism over having such a horrible burden placed on his burden . \\ni think that people are generally tempted by the fact that genetics can actually create perfection in a child , but whether or not they would actually act on this temptation is something i\\'m not sure of . \\n \" gattaca \" warns us not to go any farther , chiefly because we\\'ll create a world of elitism where the elite are shallow and unhappy , and as bitter and angry as the lesser people are . \\nand when i see a possible future featuring a 12-fingered piano player , well folks , that just creeps me out . \\n',\n",

       "  b\"in 1912 , a ship set sail on her maiden voyage across the atlantic for america . \\nthis ship was built to be the largest ship in the world , and she was . \\nshe was also build to be one of the most luxurious , and that she was . \\nfinally , she was built to be unsinkable and that unfortunately she was not . \\nto get a ticket for this voyage you either : spent a life's savings to get to america to start life anew , were part of the upper class and had the money to spare , or finally were lucky enough to have a full house in a poker match by the docks like jack dawson . \\njack dawson makes the trip , and happens to be at the right place at the right time . \\nrose dewitt bukater , a first class passenger , climbs the railings at the aft of the ship with thoughts of jumping . \\nthus is started a tale of romance and intrigue , and a tale of death and tragedy . . . \\nthis movie is about a tragic event that took place a great many years ago , an even that should not be taken lightly as any other bit of historical trivia . \\nthe movie titanic shows what happened , maybe not with a 100% degree of accuracy , but it still shows it very realisticaly . \\nnow the titanic is both a story on its own and a backdrop for a story . \\nit serves as both admirably , brining forth an interesting story that although simple in its most simple premise is very captivating . \\nthis movie is very emotional simply because of what it is , but that alone is not enough . \\nthe story is brought out with a certain style that makes is so much more emotional and so much more effective . \\nmovies such as this will not be forgotten all too quickly and unfortunately then are not something that is produced by hollywood with any great frequency . \\nthe attention to detail that was paid is remarkable . \\nthe whole premise for the telling of the story is interesting , with the showing of brand new footage from the wreck of the titanic adding much flavor to an already good movie . \\npart of the magical chemistry behind this story is the acting , and for this movie its extremely good acting from the whole cast . \\nthe performances put in by the main stars is something to be admired . \\nthe characters were played out so memorably that both leonardo dicaprip and kate winslet should receive at the least nominations for their roles . \\nlooking at the acting done in the movie it seems as if they aren't acting but are actually the characters in the movie . \\nthe casting for the movie could really have been better , in my humble opinion that is . \\none character that will most likely not be mentioned by any other review or commentary about this film is that of the ship itself . \\nyes , you read correctly , the ship is a character . \\nhow is the titanic a character ? \\nyou ask well simple , a ship had a certain character about it and as most sailors and boats men will tell you . \\nthis character is everything about the ship from its specifications to its luxuries and the titanic was no stranger to this . \\nmr . cameron brings the ship to life in an almost literal sense . \\nall this adds to the movie in a certain way that most hollywood productions cant seem to grasp . \\nnow , to produce the effect that i mentioned above and to sink the ship itself are feats that are accomplished by special effects wizards . \\nthe effects in this movie range from marvelous costumes to beautifully rendered scenes of the ships sinking . \\nin some respects you cannot tell that the effects are there , you simply think that what you see is what happened or what is happening ( if your imagination is good ) . \\nthe technical wizardry done in this movie is just spectacular and actually getting new footage from the wreck of the titanic is unique . \\nthe movie will leave you amazed at the effects , and that is a feat since there is no monsters or aliens in this movie , just humans and an oversized ship . \\nthe movie will amaze you and it will pull on your emotions , the theater that i went to had a few people leaving with tears in their eyes . \\nnow that is not a feat accomplished by most movies , now the fact that the tragedy actually occurred is brought home with something of a punch , i wont spoil the ending and say what happens regardless it is an interesting movie from beginning to the very end . \\nthe historical value of this movie is quite high , and honestly is something that should be watched for the sake of seeing it and seeing the tragedy , for it is extremely well done . \\nthe method of telling the story is also good , maybe not totally unique but effective none the less . \\nregardless of anything mentioned above this movie is a grandiose production and the sheer size of the project undertaken is something to be marveled at . \\nthe simple fact that the movie is smashingly successful at what it aims to achieve is just astonishing . \\nif you get the chance to see this movie go ! ! ! \\nit might not be the best movie in the world . . \\nbut it ranks fairly highly and is well worth the time spent watching it . \\nduring none of the 3 hours and 13 minutes of the movie are you bored nor does your attention wane from the movie . \\n\",\n",

       "  b'director david fincher has such an eye for detail which is very rare in hollywood these days ( terry gilliam comes to mind as another one ) . \\nfilm is one of the best art forms because not only can you tell a story , but you can use the camera to capture the smallest detail and have it mean something . \\nbut most directors seem to go for action with the slightest ounce of a story . \\nso whenever a director uses the camera to its fullest potential , the film almost automatically deserves a good review . \\nand when they add a fascinating story to it , you have nearly perfect entertainment . \\nfincher\\'s the game is no exception to this . \\nthe game is one of the most interesting and complex films to come out of hollywood in a long time . \\nfincher hasn\\'t made a film since \" seven , \" his box office and critical hit which defied expectations and became one of the best movies ever . \\nso it is about time he made another film . \\nand what a ride it is . \\nthe game isn\\'t quite as powerful as \" seven , \" but in some ways it is better . \\noverall , the game could have used a little more clarity , or a little more uncertainty . \\nit walks a line of insanity and reality , but it never goes either way until the very end . \\nthe outcome is satisfying enough for the preceding events , and it makes a lot of sense once everything is set straight . \\nunfortunately , unlike \" the usual suspects , \" we are never given enough information to figure out for ourselves what is happening , whether it be true or false . \\nhowever , this also gives the film a frightening aspect which the game uses to the fullest extent . \\nthe game is told completely from its main character\\'s point of view . \\nnicholas van orton ( michael douglas ) is a high-strung and isolated businessman . \\nhe lives alone in his giant mansion , divorced from his wife elizabeth , and is celebrating his 48th birthday ; the same age at which his father committed suicide at , in the same mansion . \\nfor his 48th birthday , conrad ( sean penn ) , the rebel of the family , gives nicholas a gift certificate to crs : consumer recreation services . \\n \" it will make your life fun again , \" his brother promises . \\nas skeptical as nicholas is , he is somewhat intrigued , and annoyed by the lack of information--something this businessman hates . \\nseeing a billboard in an office , he decides to visit the mysterious company . \\njim feingold ( james rebhorn ) greets nicholas and guides him through the sign-up process , which consists of psych-tests , physicals , emotional responses , and other mind games . \\n \" each game is suited to each person\\'s emotional and psychological needs , \" explains feingold . \\none day , nicholas gets a call from crs and they explain that he failed the tests . \\neven more intrigued and now somewhat angered at the time he spent signing up , he starts asking around to see what people can tell him about the company . \\nwhat he doesn\\'t realize is that the game has already begun . \\nthe phone call is just the first of many strange events to be thrown nicholas\\' way . \\nhow he finds out that he is involved has to be witnessed because it is amusing and fun and visually impressive . \\nthe detail involved in fincher\\'s shots is incredible and almost requires a second viewing just to appreciate the effort that went into them . \\nwith \" seven , \" fincher had almost every single shot mean something . \\nhe also has the unique ability to make you look at exactly what he wants you to . \\ncompared to \" seven , \" though , the game is light and comical . \\nbecause of this film\\'s sense of humor and self-awareness , nothing can be taken quite seriously . \\nso don\\'t try to make much sense of what goes on in the game , because it doesn\\'t want you to . \\nwhat does make sense is the final revelation--when everything becomes apparent and clear . \\nif taken as it is , the game\\'s ending makes complete sense . \\nbut if you try and critique every minute detail , then you get yourself into plot holes and incredibility . \\nperhaps that is the reason i docked the film . \\nwhile trying to remain realistic and plausible , the plot is too unbelievable to create any real tension on screen . \\nwe don\\'t really care if douglas\\' character lives or not because it isn\\'t believable . \\nthe ending requires you to have believed anything that has happened previously , but if you suspend disbelief and take the film as it is , you can accept the game as an emotionally and psycholically disturbing thriller . \\nmichael douglas gives a terrific performance as nicholas . \\ndouglas has played lonely businessmen before , but here he adds another level to his performance . \\nhis character , who is normally level-headed and relies on facts , is forced to trust nobody . \\ncan he believe the waitress he bumped into ? \\nwhat about his brother who got him involved in the game in the first place ? \\ndouglas portrays this aspect of his character extremely well , and gives one of his best performances ( even better than his \" falling down \" persona ) . \\nthe supporting cast is essential in this film , and casting was critical . \\nsean penn is always good , and he gives yet another credible performance as douglas\\' brother . \\ndeborah kara unger ( from \" crash \" ) is the waitress he bumps into , and her performance is extremely good . \\nin fact , she almost steals the film from douglas . \\njames rebhorn portrays his character very well , and adds some confusion and desparation to douglas\\' predicament . \\nanother good performance comes from armin mueller-stahl ( from \" shine \" ) as the book editor . \\nbut considering that douglas is in every single scene of the game , he not only commands this cast , but makes this distant and lonely character come to colorful life . \\nthe game is rated r for language , violence , some gore , and some nudity and drugs . \\nwhat is essential for this film to work is the writing . \\njohn brancato and michael ferris have woven a confusing and compelling screenplay with witty dialogue , and some very funny moments . \\nthis screenplay will probably get an oscar nomination for best original screenplay because it does almost exactly the same thing the usual suspects\\' did . \\nhowever , the visuals of the game are enough to make the viewer enjoy the vexing plot . \\nand if you can get yourself to believe everything occuring on the screen , you will be thoroughly entertained by one of this year\\'s best films . \\n',\n",

       "  b'by the time dennis quaid , the ostensible star of switchback , makes his first appearance at about the 22-minute mark , you may find yourself wondering why he bothered . \\nafter all , writer/director jeb stuart has already set up a fairly promising pair of parallel story lines . \\nthe first finds amarillo , texas sheriff buck olmstead ( r . lee ermey ) facing a hotly-contested election battle just as a brutal double homicide is discovered at a motel in his jurisdiction . \\nas olmstead begins his investigation , we also meet the two men who come to be our prime suspects . \\nlane dixon ( jared leto ) is an enigmatic young hitchhiker ; bob goodall ( danny glover ) is the jovial motorist who offers lane a ride from texas to his utah destination . \\nall the necessary conflicts seem to be in place -- the internal struggle of olmstead over the clash between good politics and good police work , and the external struggle as one of the two travelers eventually becomes villain to the other\\'s protagonist . \\nbut then quaid shows up as grimly determined fbi agent frank lacrosse . \\nlacrosse is certain that the amarillo murders are the work of a serial killer he has been tracking for nearly two years . \\nhe\\'s not supposed to be tracking him any more -- according to the bureau , they\\'ve got their man -- but lacrosse has a very important reason for believing otherwise . \\ntwo months earlier , lacrosse\\'s own son was kidnapped by the killer , and the boy has yet to turn up anywhere . \\nlacrosse knows his killer\\'s work , and he knows that the man is still out there somewhere trying to continue their game . \\nit wouldn\\'t be fair to reduce everything that\\'s wrong with switchback to quaid\\'s presence , but it\\'s a pretty good place to start . \\nthere\\'s a reason lacrosse feels like an intruder in the narrative instead of its vital center : as a dramatic actor , dennis quaid possesses exactly one facial expression and one vocal intonation . \\nwe can tell lacrosse is determined because his face is a perpetual tight-jawed , sourpuss pucker ; we can tell he\\'s grim because every word comes out in an eastwood-esque rasp . \\na more flexible performer might have given weight to the character , pulling the audience into his haunted intensity , making switchback _his_ film . \\nquaid merely looks annoyed and slightly constipated . \\nit\\'s tough to become emotionally invested in a character\\'s turmoil when it looks like all he really needs is a big bowl of bran flakes . \\neven without quaid , it doesn\\'t appear that switchback would have stayed on course . \\nthe early scenes between leto and glover have a lively energy , building our curiosity over which man -- the taciturn kid or his gregarious benefactor -- is the real threat . \\nunfortunately , stuart tips his hand far too early in the game , both through the pitch of the individual performances and the facts he chooses to reveal . \\nonce the mystery of the killer\\'s identity is dispatched , the interaction between leto and glover becomes stale and predictable . \\nin fact , \" stale and predictable \" describes the direction that switchback takes in general , falling back on far-too-common hollywood devices like cats jumping out of nowhere , a climactic fistfight on board a freight train , and edgy law enforcement agents . \\nit\\'s too bad stuart wasn\\'t willing to spend more time with sheriff olmstead , far and away the most interesting and appealing character in the film . \\nplayed with atypical restraint by r . lee ermey , he\\'s a wonderful , unconventional hero who seems genuinely comfortable accepting the consequences of acting on his convictions . \\na film focusing on the olmstead would have signaled a film-maker willing to take a few risks with his casting and story-telling . \\ninstead , stuart places his trust in a \" name \" star who can\\'t carry the material . \\nmaybe next time he\\'ll throw away that one crucial page in the script , the one where the grimly determined fbi agent wanders onto the scene to muck up a perfectly good story . \\n',\n",

\\n \" now we have to have a couple of zany friends for out hero who might get him into mischief , but cover for him or come to his rescue when he needs it . \\nwe\\'ve already had a fish and a crab , and we\\'ve had a candle and a teapot , a genie and a dog , a few stone statues . . . . have \\nwe had an ape and an elephant yet ? \\nwell , there we go ! \" \\nof course , there\\'s gotta be romance somewhere along the line , so jane ( minnie driver ) gets introduced about halfway through . \\ntogether with her father dr . porter ( nigel hawthorne ) and the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , jane is on an expedition to find and study the wild gorillas of africa . \\nshe discovers the man raised by apes and is enchanted almost immediately , and soon shares an amusing version of the compulsory \" you tarzan , me jane \" scene . \\nthankfully , those aren\\'t the exact words . \\nhowever , i found it distracting that tarzan is going \" ohh ohh ee ee \" one second and then tells jane his name in this manly voice with perfect diction . \\nhow does he tell his name to another ape ? \\n \" ohh ohh ee - tarzan - ee ee ohh ? \" \\nwell , regardless of my picky nature , the romance actually works as only disney romance can : purely contrived , but for some reason rather believable . \\nbut hey , tarzan\\'s a young adult . \\ndo you think he dated a few of the female apes before meeting jane ? \\nisn\\'t that illegal in most countries ? \\noh , well . \\ni don\\'t think disney will be using my quote anymore . \\ntarzan departs from the usual disney feature in that this one is not a musical . \\nthere\\'s lots of music to be sure , but not a single character song in the whole hour and a half of running time . \\nwe instead get more of a phil collins concert , as no less than five of his original songs are used as interlude material . \\nthis isn\\'t really a bad thing , as the songs are very high-energy and catchy ( i found myself singing one to myself for most of the following day ) ; it\\'s just different . \\ndo yourself a favor and see this film in a theater with a good sound system , because the music will come through astonishingly well and really enhance the movie . \\nwith each new feature , disney animation gets even better . \\nnot necessarily by leaps and bounds , but since they put out a new film each year , a steady rate of improvement is apparent , and this definitely shows in tarzan . \\nthere are a couple of scenes where the animation achieves a near 3-d effect , and a number of scenes which feature tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying . \\nthe way he slides down tree limbs and trunks is very reminiscent of skateboarding and rollerblading maneuvers , and had me thinking this isn\\'t just tarzan , it\\'s \" extreme tarzan . \" \\nhowever , tarzan does not seem to have what i call its \" chandelier scene , \" which is the one scene to which the animators have chosen to devote an inordinate amount of effort , utilizing a computer-assisted process that makes the animation absolutely breathtaking . \\nlasting but a few seconds at most , it\\'s been the signature of nearly every disney animated feature since beauty and the beast , in which the castle ballroom chandelier was rendered in stunning detail . \\nas usual , the voice talent is up to snuff , convincingly make you believe in the convictions of animated characters . \\nthe one poor choice in casting , however , was rosie o\\'donnell . \\ngoing into the film , i didn\\'t know she was even a part of it , but when terk started talking , i recognized her voice immediately . \\nher performance was fine , but through the rest of the film i kept thinking , \" that\\'s no boy ape , that rosie o\\'donnell . \" \\ndistracting to say the least . \\ni\\'ll admit i\\'ve never read the edgar rice burroughs story \" tarzan of the apes , \" so i couldn\\'t tell you how true this film stays to the book . \\nbut unless you\\'re a purist , you should have few objections to this film . \\nwith solid performances , action , adventure , a bit of romance , and great music and animation , tarzan should appeal to the kids and to the kid in all of us . \\nnote : when i wrote my review of mulan a year ago , i went off on the promotional and merchandising tie-ins prevalent with the release of a disney animated feature . \\nthis time , i\\'ll just say that i went to mcdonald\\'s yesterday to treat myself to a mcflurry , and tarzan was on the cup . \\n\\'nuff said . \\n',\n",

\\nthat way nobody gets hurt . \" . \\nbut if the film delivers much more than a trite message , it\\'s because we are also shown how hard it can be to face up to ugly truths , even while the evasions and unspoken grievances slowly choke us . \\nhence , cynthia\\'s difficulty with acknowledging ( first to herself , then to others ) that hortense is her daughter . \\none of her first reactions to seeing hortense is a sincere denial that she has ever \" been with a black man \" , before a long-suppressed memory seizes her . \\nat the party , cynthia\\'s pretense that hortense is her factory co-worker leads her to ever more convoluted lies , as agonizing as they are funny . \\nlittle lies seep into every corner , like maurice pretending that he\\'s \" just dropping by \" when he visits cynthia after much deliberation . \\nmaurice\\'s job as a photographer gives the film opportunities for side comments on the main theme - a sad-looking bride that maurice coaxes to smile , a couple who pose awkwardly with a prominent wedding ring and argue about his spectacles . \\none of the most startling images is of a beautiful woman with large scars on her face : she says she needs the photo to look \" as bad as possible \" to collect insurance money , yet the short scene leaves you wondering about what untold story lies behind the scars . \\nthere are occasionally hilarious moments , as when cynthia attempts to give her daughter some unwelcome advice on contraception , \" i\\'ve got a dutch cap floating about somewhere upstairs \" ; or when cynthia stares at her own rather pedestrian legs and tells roxanne , \" if you\\'ve got it , flaunt it , is what i say . \" \\nas played by brenda blethyn , cynthia comes close to being a caricature , with her nervous , somewhat disconnected way of talking . \\nbut she\\'s really just right for the role of someone who inspires sympathy and yet strains the tolerance of those around her , precisely because she\\'s so needy of love , perhaps . \\nindeed , the whole cast gives warmly rounded , detailed performances . \\nthe script was developed partly through improvisations , and the fusion of cast , script and director shows best in the party scene - seemingly everyone is talking at the same time , and yet many subtle observations are being made throughout . \\nin a very different way , but also using a long single shot , the scene of hortense and cynthia\\'s first meeting in a lonely caf=8a achieves a touching intensity , all the more for their reticence and unspoken feelings . \\nthe film\\'s climax - with all the secrets and lies finally spilled out in ibsen-esque revelations , and everybody hugging each other - is the one thing that seems false about this film . \\nhowever , it\\'s a film that truly earns its happy ending after the misery and repression of the character\\'s lives . \\nwhen cynthia says near the end , this is the life , innit ? , you get the sense that , following the cynicism of his last film naked , leigh has rediscovered that life can be sweet after all , without comforting illusions . \\nthe flying inkpot\\'s rating system : * wait for the video . \\n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \\n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \\n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \\n * * * * * perfection . \\nsee it twice . \\n',\n",

       "  b'i have to say it . \\ntim burton\\'s retelling of planet of the apes is more fun than a barrel of monkeys . \\nok , that\\'s off my chest . \\nno more monkey puns , i promise . \\nseriously , though , planet of the apes is one rip-roarin\\' summer outing , filled with thrills , action , adventure , wit and bits of funny ( dare i say , monkey ) business . \\ni know , i know , i promised . \\nand for those film buffs who are fond of the original , burton\\'s version includes a couple tips of the hat to that movie . \\nmark wahlberg stars as capt . leo davidson , a deep-space pilot whose ship gets drawn into a magnetic field and hurled into the future . \\nhe crash lands on a planet where apes are the dominant species and humans are hunted , captured and sold into slavery . \\ndespite being darker than the original , burton\\'s film is not as heavy handed nor as sanctimonious . \\nsome of the movie\\'s flashes of humor are surreal as well as typically burton : an organ-grinder ape with a midget or an elderly ape taking off a wig and removing false teeth as he prepares for bed . \\nthen there are the parents who buy a little girl as a pet for there young daughter . \\nthe seller advises the parents to get rid of the girl before she reaches puberty : \" one thing you don\\'t want in your house is a human teen-ager , \" he says . \\nyou don\\'t have to be an ape to realize the truth in that statement . \\ntouches such as these are what stamps this movie with burton\\'s brand . \\nlines that hearken back to the original movie are sprinkled throughout : the first words spoken by an ape to davidson as the astronaut is regaining consciousness and grabs the simian\\'s foot to try righting himself are : \" take your stinking hand off of me , you damned , dirty human . \" \\nanyone familiar with the first version of the film will , of course , recognize the irony in that piece of dialogue . \\nanother of burton\\'s in-jokes is to have charlton heston , star of the original , play the chimpanzee father of tim roth\\'s gen . thade . \\nthe young chimp goes to visit his dying father . \\nboth have one thing in common , a hatred of humans . \\nwith his dying breath , the elder spews out his vile : \" damn them , damn them all to hell , \" he says before expiring . \\nthat is the famous line heston\\'s taylor shouted at the conclusion of the original after discovering the planet\\'s terrible secret . \\nthe performances throughout are top-notch . \\nwahlberg plays davidson not as some gung-ho hero , but as a confused and somewhat frightened explorer who only wants to return home . \\nhe is reluctant to lead the human rebellion ; his only objective being to find a way off this upside-down planet . \\nthis hesitation is what makes his character believable and vulnerable . \\nroth is ferocious , cunning , cruel and savage as the fascist chimp who wants to rid his planet of all vestiges of humanity . \\nhe leaps and bounds as if he had springs on his feet . \\nit is a masterful turn . \\nhelena bonham carter is ari , the chimp who believes that apes and humans can live in peace and as equals . \\nhers is a smart , compassionate characterization . \\nmichael clarke duncan is big and brutal as attar the gorilla aid to thade who blindly follows his leader until his faith is shaken . \\na fine comic outing is given by paul giamatti as limbo , the ape slave trader making a living off the misery of the humans he captures . \\nas the battle between apes and humans looms , the cowardly limbo pleads , \" can\\'t we all just get along , \" echoing the words of rodney king . \\nmuch of the success of planet of the apes goes to burton\\'s technical crew , especially production designer rick heinrichs and the legendary rick baker who created the ape makeup . \\nburton\\'s musical collaborator , danny elfman , provides another fine score , though it is not as memorable as his work on batman or sleepy hollow . \\nthe movie\\'s only letdown comes at the very end where burton tries to outshock the finale from the 1968 original . \\nhe comes close , but falls short . \\notherwise , planet of the apes is what a summer movie should be : an amusement park ride filled with lots of action , stunts and a few laughs . \\nthis is one feature in which the expectations lived up to the pre-release hype . \\n',\n",

       "  b'writers : dennis feldman and jonathan hensleigh ( based on the comic book by chuck pfarrer ) \\nstarring : jamie lee curtis , william baldwin , donald sutherland , joanna pacula , sherman augustus , marshall bell , cliff curtis , julio oscar mechoso \\ni suppose i\\'m not extremely surprised that \" virus \" comes to us from a deciple of james cameron ( john bruno ) , and if i strain real hard , i could even say that it\\'s an obvious given , particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr . cameron\\'s early works . \\nin fact , \" virus \" is yet another in the long line of action/horror/paranoia thrillers from the \" aliens \" vein : a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only to find a mortally-threatening entity is out to get them , a textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies , and maybe even to the first pictures , albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future . \\nno such thing will happen to bruno , whom i believe worked in some capacity on that quasi-landmark feature ; while bruno may have studied under cameron\\'s wing for years and years , i\\'m beginning to wonder at what capacity , and what exactly did he learn from him . \\nin fact , \" virus \" should at least be mediocre ; the fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron - a director who , if anything , just knows how to make a movie - and then make a film like \" virus \" is just another detraction fairly aimed at this z-grade schlockfest of a film , albeit a z-grade schlockfest with a respectable budget . \\nthe film seems to not only borrow it\\'s plot from last year\\'s similarly-fated \" deep rising , \" but also from a clunkish b-movie from the \\'80s called \" leviathan , \" an underwater thriller starring peter weller , richard crenna , hector elizando , and daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part \" alien , \" part john carpenter\\'s twisted remake of \" the thing . \" \\n \" virus , \" again , has a similar , uh , selling point : a group of sailors on a boat stumble upon a russian cruiser that is dead in the water . \\nthey get on . \\nthey break up into pairs and investigate . \\nand they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy , has taken over all the machines on board , have meshed the machines with parts from corpses , and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary ( ha ha ) . \\nnot that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving ; not only does this film start off with a chintzy bond-ian opening ( the destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from mir ) , destroying any of the suspense in what could happen , but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters . \\nof its motley crew , it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper , a masculine potential-romantic-interest , a drunken captain , a black technician , a tatooed aborigine , a manic russian survivor , and a couple other candidates for alien food , none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than a thin , plain piece of writing paper . \\nand it\\'s not the traditional argument for films like these , where you may in fact want them all to be eaten ( even \" aliens \" played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers , but this was more of a plus-side for the film as a whole than the opposite ) ; instead , as another cliche goes , you just don\\'t give a damn . \\ni almost don\\'t even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from sub-par to horrific , the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is ( and she is , just not really here ) and the latter being - and it pains me to say this as he\\'s a particular favorite of mine - donald sutherland , who plays the captain so poorly and without a second of credibility that this will go down as the performance-of-which-he-should-be-ashamed . \\nlike anthony hopkins for \" legends of the fall \" ( the line \" scrooooooo \\'em \" has been thus embroidered upon my membrance ) . \\nor peter o\\'toole in \" caligula . \" \\ngreat actor , horrific performance . \\nit happens every now and then , and it only helps sutherland\\'s career that no one , except for an elite few , even bothered to see this film . \\nthough it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years , waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can ( read : early january , when everyone\\'s still trying to catch up on the potential oscar-nominees ) , it does show that universal shelled out a pretty penny to make this film : it\\'s laden with complex machinery , boasts respectable production design , and it may even feature believable special effects . . . if , of course , i , or anyone else , could see them . \\n \" virus \" mostly takes place on a large , abandoned cruiser , and mostly at night until the dawn , and mostly without the use of lights , not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey , but more so because , as the hollywood cliche seems to go , \" if it\\'s dark enough , then the special effects will be more believable . \" \\nand if you don\\'t believe me , go back and rent \" godzilla , \" and tell me if there\\'s even one shot where we see godzilla either a ) in his entirety in one wide shot , or b ) n the light so that we can at least see him ( well , you don\\'t really have to sit through it again ; just take my word for it ) . \\nbut all of this doesn\\'t matter since \" virus \" is basically just one loud , cluttered mess of a movie . \\nthe action scenes are muddled and as difficult to follow as any action movie i\\'ve ever seen ( my , um , favorite part was the scene where a trio of them end up somehow on the outside of the ship , during a five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves , rain , and any other ocean-extremeties the film can cook up , then end up back in the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned - well , i must say , thanks for telling me afterwards because i sure couldn\\'t figure it out when i saw it ) . \\nimagine the first attack of the aliens in \" aliens , \" shot from the pov of the soldiers and then the authorities in the battle car if it was all hard to follow and done without any dramatic intensity , and that\\'s basically the whole of \" virus \" : one horribly-directed action scene after the other , capping it off with a proposterous gadget that saves the day and at least a couple of the original cast members . \\nand my god , it\\'s a long damn sit . \\nwith no interesting characters , no dramatic urgency , no tension , not one good moment of action , and no mesmerizing visuals , it\\'s a wonder that it even got made . \\nwe already know that big movie studios\\' mentality is shallow at best , and movies like \" out of sight \" and \" saving private ryan \" give you more faith in them , but movies like \" virus \" manage to drain a little more out of the pool . \\ni almost wish that instead of making this movie , john bruno had gone cinema verite and captured the meetings with universal heads when they gave this film a green light . \\nthey read the script , they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into a director who might have very well been a cameron hack ( and he is ) , and they still went ahead with the project , only to have bruno and company shit back in their face . \\neven though i hold universal in contempt for making this horrible movie , i\\'d say even more contempt should be aimed at mr . bruno for making a movie that could be this bad . \\nin fact , shouts of \" egad , man , what were you doing when you worked for cameron anyway ? \" \\nare not only justifiable , but encouraged . \\n',\n",

       "  b'since director steven zaillian previously wrote the powerful screenplay for 1993\\'s steven spielberg drama \" schindler\\'s list \" and directed 1993\\'s intelligent \" searching for bobby fischer , \" his new film , \" a civil action , \" should most likely be looked upon as an unfortunate misstep in an otherwise prosperous career . \\nwhat doesn\\'t make sense is how such high-profile and superb actors as john travolta , robert duvall , william h . macy , and kathleen quinlan got involved in this project , which is both dull and completely ineffective . \\nthe film , which involves a small community of children who mysteriously died of leukemia , certainly contains the type of story to be emotionally-charged , but somehow all signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings , leaving us with nothing more than a poorly-done courtroom drama . \\nbased on a book by jonathan hart , which was consequently based on a true account , \" a civil action \" is set in 1982 in the town of woburn , mass . , where personal injury lawyer jan schlictmann ( john travolta ) decides to take on the case of eight families who simply want an apology for their children\\'s death from leukemia due to unknown causes . \\njan originally decides to drop the case , but when he stumbles across to corporate giants , grace and beatrice foods , who have plants located near the families\\' homes , he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall into place : the two companies have been leaking harmful chemicals into the nearby lake which , thus , goes into the city\\'s drinking water . \\nsuddenly , after hearing about the families\\' heartbreak and personal stories , he begins to care for them and becomes determined to get to the bottom of the mystery , even though he is warned by his staff accountant ( william h . macy ) that no money is coming in to them , only going out . \\nalso figuring into the story is jerome facher ( robert duvall ) , beatrice foods\\' corporate counsel , who finds himself in heated waters when jan will not accept his $20-million offer to settle the case . \\ncoming from such a talented writer , director , and cast , not to mention one of the most interesting film composers , danny elfman , \" a civil action \" is an astoundingly empty-headed drama , one that includes an intriguing story and somehow transforms it into an admittedly tiresome and occasionally even boring experience . \\nperhaps one of its major problems was that in its attempts to be a relatively uncommercial motion picture , zaillian has misplaced its refreshing unconventional attitude with an absence of magnetism and even meaning . \\nwatching the film , i couldn\\'t help but notice its similarities with 1997\\'s far , far superior film \" the sweet hereafter , \" which dealt with a lawyer , played brilliantly by ian holm , investigating a school bus accident that killed a number of children . \\nin his attempts to find someone who may have been responsible for the accident , holm interviews the grieving parents , as well as the sole surviving passenger , a teenage girl , which starts to remind him of his own teenage daughter , a young drug-addict who has run away from home . \\nnot only was the plotting similar to \" a civil action , \" but it also had the same exact running time of 115 minutes . \\nconsidering this , it is amazing how fulfilling and truthful \" a sweet hereafter \" was , not only concentrating on the school bus accident , but delving deeply into ian holm\\'s character and his own personal demons , as well as the teenage girl . \\nin \" a civil action , \" however , i have no idea where the running time went , since the film is virtually two hours of nothingness . \\nwe do not get to know the parents very well , nor any of the main characters . \\nthrough its whole duration , i did not learn one thing__not one thing__about travolta\\'s lawyer character , jan schlictmann , who doesn\\'t appear to have any sort of life or purpose outside of his job . \\nevery scene is tediously related directly to the premise , and therefore , there was no one for me to care about or root for . \\nyou\\'ve got to work pretty hard , actually , to not get an audience to become involved in the parents\\' plight , since their children are dead , but that is exactly what \" a civil action \" does . \\nto be honest , i would be fairly hard-pressed to state an aspect of the film that i actually liked . \\naside from one flashback to when a man\\'s young son died on the way to the doctor , i remained unmoved and passive about what was going on in the scenes , and more than once found my mind wandering . \\ni could say the performances were good , but who\\'s fooling who ? \\nsince every character is one-dimensionally written , no one\\'s acting abilities are challenged in any way . \\ntravolta plays a lawyer well enough , but that\\'s about all he does . \\nduvall virtually sleepwalks through his role , apparently only appearing to give one-liners at every chance he gets . \\nand what in the world is kathy bates doing in the picture\\'s final scene , as a judge ? \\nshe appears unbilled , since it is just a cameo , but why did she even agree to do it in the first place ? \\nfinally , when the conclusion arrived and the end credits began to role , the film left me with another question : what was the point ? \\nabruptly ending without any susceptible momentum , where none came before that to begin with , \" a civil action \" seemed to me , at least , to be an example of how not to make a courtroom drama , and it certainly did not do justice to the very serious subject matter the film deals with . \\n',\n",
       "  b'i remember hearing about this film when it first appeared at cannes over a year ago , picking up the grand jury prize at the festival . \\n\\'holocaust comedy receives standing ovation\\' , the headlines read . \\nintrigued by this statement , i looked up information on the film and found that , sure enough , life is beautiful is in fact a comedy about the greatest atrocity of the last thousand years . \\neven though the movie was extremely well-received by critics and public alike , i couldn\\'t help but be disgusted at this notion ; human tragedy is not something i feel should be celebrated . \\nonly now do i see the error of my ways . \\nafter finally viewing the film for myself after avoiding it for some time , it became clear that it is not , as the headlines proclaimed , a \" holocaust comedy \" ; on the contrary , life is beautiful does not even really depict the graphic events that took place in nazi deathcamps . \\nrather , it focuses on the relationship between a father and his son , who he is trying desperately to shield from the horrors of their situation . \\nroberto benigni ( who also wrote and directed the movie ) stars as guido orefice , a chaplin-inspired clown and all round jolly guy who , as the film opens , is vying for the affections of an attractive school teacher ( nicoletta braschi , benigni real life spouse ) . \\nthrough the course of the first hour or so , we see guido striving to get the attention of this \" beautiful princess \" , as he calls her . \\nemploying the magic of laughter , the italian comedian wins her heart and together , they raise a young boy named giosue ( child actor giorgio cantarini ) . \\nlife treats them well until hitler\\'s minions rise to power , and the family is whisked away to a german camp , where guido becomes convinced that he must upholds his son\\'s innocence no matter what the sacrifice . \\ngranted , it contains some uproariously funny moments both in and out of the concentration camp , but it does not pull a \" hogan\\'s heros \" and make light of the slaughtering of some six million innocent jews . \\nsomehow , it achieves hilarity without disrespecting it\\'s gravely serious subject . \\nso , we\\'ve established that life is beautiful is not a \" holocaust comedy \" . \\nbut , there is another complete misrepresentation of this material that really disturbs me . \\nthe film , despite critic\\'s declarations of it being a \" triumph of the human spirit \" , is no such thing ; not in my eyes , anyway . \\nsome have called the story an \" affirmation of the beauty of life \" , but i say it is a very dark and bleak statement about man\\'s capability of denial masquerading as an endearing comedy . \\nthe film\\'s ending has been recognized as the most entirely uplifting moment of any film released recently , but i found it to be truly discerning and upsetting . \\nessentially , life is beautiful is quite possibly the greatest hoax in the history of film . \\nhowever , i am not denying the movie\\'s greatness . \\nbelieve me , it\\'s fantastic . \\ni\\'m just saying that i think benigni did something different than what most people are interpreting it as . \\nbut perhaps i\\'m reading more into the movie than is really there . \\nmaybe the film\\'s brilliance relies on the idea that the viewer can interpret the meaning of it in any way they see fit . \\nin fact , maybe roberto benigni has made a film that is the sole argument for the old saying that you get out of a movie exactly what you put into it . \\n',\n",

       "  b'look back at all the times in your life when there was a fork in the path to the future . \\nsome sort of decision had to be made , and , for better or worse , it irrevocably altered the course of your existence . \\n>from time-to-time , everyone thinks about the roads not taken , and how things might have turned out if the choice had been different . \\nperhaps even more dizzying to contemplate is how a seemingly minor action -- catching the 10 am train , for example -- could have an equally profound , yet less obvious , impact . \\nmaybe that\\'s where you met your significant other , and , had you reached the platform just a few seconds later ? \\nfilm makers are no less fascinated by issues of destiny than anyone else , and that\\'s why there\\'s no shortage of movies about this subject . \\nthe best of the bunch were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski , who was obsessed with questions of fate and chance . \\nthese themes weave their way through many of his movies , including decalogue , the double life of veronique , and the triptych of blue , white , and red . \\nhowever , they are most explicitly examined in a 1981 film called blind chance , where kieslowski presents the three different fates of one man after a minor action ( missing or catching a train ) changes the course of his life . \\nin his autobiography , kieslowski on kieslowski , the director describes his attraction to the concept this way : \" [the idea is] rich and interesting ? that every day we\\'re faced with a choice which could end our entire life yet of which we\\'re completely unaware . \" \\nwhile this approach has been the fodder for several notable dramatic films ( including , in a way , frank capra\\'s it\\'s a wonderful life ) , sliding doors is the first romantic comedy to plumb its depths . \\nthe \" road not taken \" approach isn\\'t just a plot device , either . \\nwriter/director peter howitt expands upon both possible fates of a character after she just misses/catches a train . \\nthe audience watches , with ever-growing fascination , how this one event impacts upon every aspect of her life : her future career , where she lives , whom she loves , and whether she has a family . \\nas her separate destinies diverge and then re-converge , she becomes two completely different individuals . \\nthat woman is helen , played by gwyneth paltrow as a long , dark- haired brit . \\none day , after losing her job as an advertising executive , she decides to return home in the middle of the day . \\nthe scene of the pivotal moment is a train platform . \\nin scenario #1 , she just slips through the sliding doors before the train pulls out of the station . \\non board , she meets the cheerful , talkative james ( john hannah ) , a monty python fan who is taken with her beauty . \\nminutes later , in her flat , she walks in on her lover , gerry ( john lynch ) , in bed with another woman ( jeanne tripplehorn ) . \\nin scenario #2 , she misses the train and , shortly thereafter , is the victim of an attempted mugging . \\nshe doesn\\'t meet james and fails to make it home in time to discover gerry\\'s infidelity . \\njuxtaposed one against the other , while sharing many places , cues , and characters , the two stories proceed in parallel from there . \\non one level , for viewers who enjoy pondering the workings of fate , sliding doors can be viewed as a deep and wonderful experience . \\nbut , for those who just appreciate a romantic comedy characterized by solid acting , a script with a few twists , and a great deal of genuinely funny material , sliding doors still fits the bill . \\none of its most obvious strengths is that it can satisfy many different types of audiences -- those who demand something substantial from their motion pictures , and those who could care less . \\nit shouldn\\'t come as any surprise that the acting , at least from three of the four leads , is solid . \\npaltrow , who does double duty as two helens who are initially the same , yet gradually become much different , is the standout . \\nshe plays both of her roles effectively and believably -- the shy , insecure woman who stays with gerry and the liberated , platinum-blond who severs the ties to her old life and embarks on a new career with a new man . \\njohn hannah , known to most american viewers as the younger gay character in four weddings and a funeral , is instantly likable . \\njohn lynch , taking a break from movies about ireland\\'s troubles , does a good job presenting gerry as a inept , selfish philanderer . \\nonly jeanne tripplehorn , who plays an over-the-top vixen , seems out of place . \\nher attempts at broad comedy are occasionally jarring , and it\\'s occasionally difficult to see her lydia as anything more than a plot element . \\none member of the supporting cast deserves special notice . \\ndouglas mcferran , who plays gerry\\'s best friend , russell , is an absolute delight , stealing every scene that he\\'s in . \\npart of this is surely because he is given the best lines in the movie . \\non one occasion , he has a marvelous monologue bemoaning how advances in the telecommunications industry have trapped men into a life of monogamy . \\non another occasion , while laughing at gerry\\'s plight with the women in his life , he comments , \" being with you makes the wait for the next episode of seinfeld more bearable . \" \\nbut it\\'s not all in the dialogue . \\nmcferran tears into this part with relish ; his performance becomes one of the most memorable aspects of a top-notch comedy . \\nthis is the first feature film for peter howitt , and he approaches the task with unimpeachable aplomb . \\nthe script is shrewd and inventive , combining wit , romance , and intelligent melodrama into a crowd-pleasing whole . \\nsliding doors grants more than just a good time at the movies , however . \\nfor those who are so inclined , its central theme offers an opportunity to ponder some of the more philosophical questions about the workings of the universe -- all while having a good time . \\n',\n",
       "  b'satirical films usually fall into one of two categories : 1 ) long-term satire where everything , including the jokes , is somehow related on a large scale ( i . e . \\n \" dr . \\nstrangelove \" ; 2 ) situation satire in which the comedy and themes are derived moment by moment and scene by scene ( i . e . \\n \" men in black \" ) . \\nwhat\\'s unique about \" wag the dog \" is that it doesn\\'t necessarily fit either of these descriptions , and yet is both at the same time . \\nthe result is a clever comedy based on an original , smart premise , even if the focus does tend to wander a bit . \\nif there\\'s anything that affects americans the most it\\'s politics and showbusiness . \\nin this age of information and technology , we\\'ve been so conditioned by the media and the entertainment industry in our ways of perceiving things , it\\'s gotten to the point that we are practically controlled by it . \\nwe need the media to bring us the most up-to-date news , but we also need the escapism of hollywood to counter all that thinking . \\nthis film starts off well by quickly establishing these ideas , and then presents an interesting scenario : if politics , the media coverage of politics , and the entertainment industry are so closely related , couldn\\'t someone with the power and authority to manipulate one of the aspects manipulate them all ? \\nthat\\'s the idea conrad brean ( de niro ) , a professional washington spin doctor , comes up with in order to restore the president\\'s good name who has been accused of child molestation just weeks before the election . \\nbrean , along with the president\\'s top advisor , winifred ames ( heche ) , fly to california to meet up with hot-shot movie producer stanley motss ( hoffman ) . \\nthey pitch him an idea to \" produce \" the image of a war with albania ( it\\'s a country no one\\'s heard of so they people will buy it ) . \\nsoon the wheels are in motion and the film\\'s riffing satire comes into play . \\nwe\\'re inundated with the hollywood mind set as motss brings in a number of experts to help manage the situation , such as a folk singer , visual and sound effects technicians , and a modern style expert known as the fad king ( leary ) . \\nthe initial atmosphere is rich with numerous pop culture references where everything somehow relates to something on tv , in the movies , or in the news . \\nthe characters\\' dialogue is witty and funny , although some of the actual jokes and gags seem rather sitcom-esque . \\nfor example , one scene shows motss and brean\\'s production crew filming an actress portraying a poor albanian refugee . \\nmotss ordered a kitten for the girl to carry , but instead wound up with a dozen different dogs . \\nsince it\\'s all computer-enhanced anyway , she ends up cradling a bag of tostitos with the kitten to be inserted later . \\nthis demonstrates the film\\'s ability to take a relatively ordinary situation and make it smart and funny just through the premise . \\nbut then there\\'s the gags and one-liners that , although are humorous , seem a little gratuitious in the long run such as motss not being able to remember the actress\\'s name , or , whenever a problem emerges , always responding with , \" this is nothing ! \" \\nby the time the film makes it to the midpoint , everything that is going to happen in terms of plot happens . \\nthe first act is quickly paced , while the second act contains most of the jokes and is the core of the film . \\nevery ten minutes or so a new problem crops up that motss and brean must deal with , and it\\'s always fascinating to see what they do and how they do it . \\nthe screenplay provides good characterization and actually deals with most of the problems head-on in realistic manners . \\nhowever , it does have a tendency to avoid things and shift its focus from the election campaign and false war smokescreen to something a bit off the subject . \\nas the third act rolls around the satirical nature becomes more concerned with the situations and less so with the big picture . \\nwhat had started off as a brilliant , somewhat harmless conspiracy to fool the general public begins to seem more like something that would happen in a movie . \\nstill , the situation comedy is quite funny , especially a montage showing the entire country flinging old shoes into trees to honor sgt . \\nwillie schumann - a war hero motss and brean concocted . \\ntruly great satire manages to create for an entertaining story that makes you laugh at the time , but think about afterwards and \" wag the dog \" at least succeeds in this respect . \\nhowever , in retrospect it seems like so much more could have been done , namely by extending the running time and filling in the plot holes . \\nthen again , it\\'s a valiant effort . \\n',\n",

intelligent relationship that develops between virgil and amy . \\nusually , romantic pictures are of the shameless puppy-dog sort ( the recent tom hanks/meg ryan-starrer \" you\\'ve got mail \" immediately pops to mind ) , but with this film , i grew to care more about the characters and their plight . \\nthe film starts off noticably well as amy travels up north and first meets virgil . \\nthe massaging sequences were strangely erotic , maybe even more so than the later actual \" love scenes , \" and as their romantic involvement quickly developed , the film was both entertaining and sweet , and there was clearly a lot of chemistry between the two . \\nthese joyous moments early on balanced out well with the later scenes in which their relationship is seriously tested due to a contrast in the life styles that they have always known , with virgil completely used to being blind and having a comforting , peaceful life in the country to amy\\'s eventful life in the \" big city . \" \\nthe other major compliment that must be given to the film are the nearly flawless performances across the board . \\nval kilmer , usually cast in the \" macho \" type of role , was always believable as a blind person , and playing his character was probably a little more tricky than it appears . \\nit was up to kilmer to not come off as someone to pity , but to sympathize with , and he pulled it off . \\nmira sorvino , who made a spectacular debuting splash in 1995\\'s hilarious woody allen comedy , \" mighty aphrodite , \" for which she won a well-deserved oscar as a kind-hearted , but ditzy hooker , is a standout here . \\nalthough she has made some mediocre film choices since then ( 1997\\'s \" mimic , \" 1998\\'s \" the replacement killers \" ) , she always has managed to come out unscathed , and it is with \" at first sight \" that she finally has another juicy role to play . \\nin a truthful climactic scene set in amy\\'s apartment between she and virgil , sorvino proves to be one of the most gifted young actresses around today , and has a flare for both comedic and dramatic pieces . \\nkelly mcgillis , who could have easily come off as the \" bad , \" one-dimensional sister , instead is also given an unexpectedly multifaceted character to play as a woman who may be overly protective but simply cares for her brother . \\nfinally , nathan lane , who is usually a little too over-the-top , is appropriately restrained as a vision therapist . \\nthe one misstep of \" at first sight \" is in its treatment of the medical procedure done on virgil . \\nvery little is ever said or discussed concerning it , and when the surgery occurs , it is so briefly glimpsed at that it is impossible to see what is being done to his eyes . \\nperhaps the reason this aspect of the film was not more in-depth was that the makers were afraid it would gross out audiences , but i would personally take realism , even if it is graphic , any day over simply giving the explanation of the surgery the cold shoulder . \\nin \" awakenings , \" the patients and illness were far more satisfyingly portrayed . \\nbecause of how strong the screenplay , written by steve levitt , is in the way it deals with the main relationship , and because of the fabulous performances from kilmer and sorvino , the film\\'s few problems can be swept over to the side . \\nthe adult way that the romance is depicted by director irwin winkler is , no doubt , in respect to the real-life couple that the film was inspired by , who are still together after many years ( even though the setting of the film was changed to new york ) . \\nsince january is usually the time of year that is known as the dumping ground from bad movies , \" at first sight \" comes as a refreshing and sophisticated change of pace . \\n',\n",

       "  b'synopsis : valerie , a high school junior who doesn\\'t look a day under 22 , writes bad poetry , complains about how much she hates school , fantasizes about a young guy on trial for raping and murdering six women , chooses him as a pen pal , and plays hooky to see him in court . \\nafter a jailbreak , the killer puts on big sunglasses , wears a half-buttoned jacket , and uses his fatal charm to go after valerie . \\ncomments : \" alan smithee \" directed fatal charm , which should have been more appropriately titled \" fatal bore \" or \" fatal crap \" . \\nif you find out that a film you\\'re about to see is directed by \" alan smithee , \" then you should seriously , seriously , seriously consider watching something , anything , else . \\n \" alan smithee \" is a pseudonym which a number of directors have used when they produce something really bad . \\nfrankly , i\\'d be embarrassed if i had directed this turkey , so i think i understand why the director might have picked the \" alan smithee \" moniker for this film . \\nwhere to begin with this painfully poor thriller ? \\nlet\\'s start with the acting . \\nit\\'s pretty bad . \\namanda peterson plays valerie and shows at least some talent ( the rest of the cast don\\'t ) , even though her performance isn\\'t exactly stellar material . \\nshe\\'s also miscast ; she seems way too old to still have a year of high school to complete . \\nher scenes with valerie\\'s mother , played by mary frann , are a joke . \\nthe two look as though they\\'re a couple of coworkers going out to lunch together , rather than a daughter with her mother who just doesn\\'t understand . \\nchristopher atkins , a handsome enough actor who plays the killer , adam , looks like a clown in the second half of fatal charm . \\ntrying to appear malicious and dangerous , he wears large sunglasses and a half-buttoned jacket . \\nif disney decided to do a zany comedy caper about the unabomber , atkins would probably be a perfect candidate for the lead , but he doesn\\'t cut it here . \\nearly on in the movie , a number of scenes occurs in a courtroom . \\noutside of the laughably poor performances given by the actors portraying lawyers , the people sitting in the benches provide the silliest effort at drama in the film . \\nthey constantly shift and turn and arc their heads in mock interest in what has got to be one of the worst perfomances that a large group of people have given at one time ever . \\nfatal charm\\'s storyline , such as it is , inspires more yawns than thrills . \\nthe script belabors a red herring , early on , about a second suspect who may have committed the murders for which adam ( atkins ) is charged with . \\nthis suspect , however , turns up strangled and drowned halfway through the film : an obvious plot fault . \\neven for the idiots who didn\\'t consider the movie\\'s title as valerie and a blond newsreporter commented how innocent and charming the defendant seemed , it becomes quite obvious that adam is dangerous when the other suspect washes up . \\nso , the audience must wait ( if they haven\\'t already stopped watching ) as the necessary details fall into place and the killer goes after the heroine in the drawn-out finale . \\nthe video box for this dud describes fatal charm as an \" erotic thriller \" . \\na thriller it isn\\'t , and neither is it particularly erotic . \\ni can\\'t imagine , if someone were in the mood for something \" erotic , \" that he\\'d be happy after watching this fluff . \\na few erotic moments occur in the film ; they take place in a van with little lighting and are filmed out of focus ( see , they\\'re supposed to be valerie\\'s fantasies -- how creative ) . \\non a personal note , i was disturbed by the ludicrous english literature class shown in this film which valerie had to suffer through . \\nit\\'s no wonder why she hated high school so much . \\nas an instructor of english myself , i have a hard time accepting the fact that in a course emphasizing great literature , a teacher would stoop to reading a student\\'s bad poetry ( of course , it\\'s valerie\\'s ) about boyfriends out loud and then embarassing its author in front of class with questions about the poem\\'s inspiration . \\ni guess the public school system is still setting dubious standards for its students . \\nfatal charm won\\'t charm anyone , unless there\\'s someone that\\'s charmed by boring , lifeless , insipid , suspenseless thrillers . \\nif you happen upon this turkey , just keep moving on . \\n',\n",

' ) \\nwhen contrasted against carter's lack of knowledge of chinese culture makes for an interesting scene where lee teaches carter the kung fu disarming trick , while carter teaches lee hip-hop dance moves . \\nwhile rush hour is not at the same level as police story 3 and 4 ( known in north america as supercop and jackie chan's first strike , respectively ) , it more than makes up for the poorly received films operation condor and mr . nice guy . \\nwith its appropriate mixture of high kicks and lots of laughs , it makes for a fun film . \\nas well , it is a true departure from jackie chan films , as it is missing one common element : a whiny female co-star . \\n\",\n",

ve humanist tale of improbable hope . \\na hapless rock group write a song about bubby and sing it for him and so give him the gift of community . \\nhe returns the favour when he steps on stage one night and becomes their frontman , turning the fragmented impressions of his experiences into performance art , and turning the band into a popular draw . \\ninnocence triumphs . \\nbubby becomes a holy fool , an idiot savant , and graces us with wisdom . \\nit\\'s a strange turn of events , but by now we shouldn\\'t be surprised , because bad boy bubby ain\\'t like other movies . \\n',\n",
       "  b'it was a rainy friday afternoon in columbus when i persuaded a friend to see a matinee performance of mst3k : tm . \\nhe had never seen any episodes of the show , and i have watched a scant few , due to its unsocial airtime on comedy central and the uneven nature of many of the episodes . \\nfor those of you not familiar with the premise , dr clayton forrester ( beaulieu ) wishes to take over the world by finding the worst film ever made and unleashing it upon an unsuspecting public . \\nto achieve this , he ( in the words of the tv series\\' theme , which is missing in the movie ) \" bumped [mike nelson ( nelson ) ] on the noggin and then shot him into space \" , and is monitoring nelson\\'s reactions to the movies he is forced to endure . \\nrather than succumb to the sheer awfulness of many of the movies , nelson spends his time making wisecracks with the help of his two robot companions , tom servo and crow t . robot . \\nthe format of the show consists of nelson , servo and crow making their comments while silhouetted against the movie being watched , and breaks every 20 minutes or so for segments set on the satellite of love , the ship on which our heroes are marooned . \\nonly two things are different in the movie : the absence of forrester\\'s sidekick , tv\\'s frank , and the slower pace of the jokes . \\nthis latter change is presumably deliberate to avoid the viewing audience missing some of the best lines while laughing from the previous joke . \\nfor their big screen outing , the producers have chosen \" this island earth \" , a 1954 classic , and one of the first sf films to have a special effects budget larger than the average grocery bill . \\nunfortunately for that film ( but making it ideal mst3k fodder ) , acting and dialogue appear to have taken a back seat to the effects which , by today\\'s standards , are less than impressive . \\nnelson & co . make jokes about everything from japan\\'s dominance in the world market , to star trek , to the state of disrepair of seattle\\'s kingdome , and most of them work . \\nunfortunately , the segments set outside the satellite\\'s movie theater seem out of place and aren\\'t particularly funny , but at least they\\'re fairly short . \\nthe big question about this movie though is : why ? \\ni presume it was an attempt to gain a larger following to keep support behind the series ( rumours of its impending demise circulated for some time before the plug was eventually pulled a few months ago ) , but the format gains nothing from its transition to the big screen -- there are no special effects to dazzle you , no action sequences to keep you on the edge of your seat , and no use of digital surround sound . \\nso , it seems pointless to spend $8 per person to see this movie when in a few months it will be out on video and you can watch it for $3 , and not have to sit in a room full of popcorn addicts . \\nnevertheless , mst3k : tm provides more laugh-out-loud opportunities than any film you\\'re going to see this year , and i thoroughly recommend it to anyone with a pulse . \\ngiven its uniqueness , i hesitate to grade it against other films , but it fulfils its claims and so in the class of \" unsubtle comedy films whose laughs come at the expense of bad b-movies \" it does well . \\n',\n",

       "  b\"it's been a long time since walt disney has delivered us a classic along the lines of the little mermaid or beauty and the beast . \\nsure , there have been delightful outings like last years hercules . \\nbut nothing entirely groundbreaking . \\nwith the release of the studio's newest feature length film , a remake of edgar rice burrough's creation tarzan , disney has plunged into new waters with both maturity and animation techniques . \\nit's no classic , but this new tarzan represents exactly what a family film should be . \\nthe plot is loyal to the original storyline , as tarzan's parents are forced to abandon their ship which has caught fire , and find shelter in the jungles of africa . \\nbut , they are killed ( offscreen ) by the snarling cheetah sabor , leaving baby tarzan alone and unharmed in his crib . \\nfound by kala ( voiced with effective gentleness by glenn close ) , a kindhearted mother and member of a gorilla pack , tarzan is taken into the primate group and raised as one of their own . \\nwe follow the young boy through the years , as he partakes in various adventures with his loud mouth gorilla friend terk ( a very brash but funny rosie o'donnell ) and clumsy elephant tantor ( wayne knight ) . \\nof course , in any disney film we are given some kind of goofy sidekick or humorous chum for the hero . \\nin tarzan , these characters fill that space rather inconspicuously . \\ngags that were magnified in other family films are kept quite minor here . \\nmost of the characters are amusing without being forced . \\nas tarzan grows to manhood , the suspected antagonist stumbles into the picture . \\nhere , the notorious bad guy is the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , who's accompanying a hapless professor ( nigel hawthorne ) on an expedition through the jungle . \\nof course , there's the professor's daughter , jane ( nicely vocalized by a cheerful minnie driver ) who will help supply the romantic quotient of the movie . \\nthe thing that blew my socks off about this version of tarzan is the stunning animation . \\ndirectors chris buck and kevin lima have applied a breathtaking 3-d element to the movement of the athletic title character , and the fast-paced editing is absolutely a marvel . \\nas tarzan carries jane through the treetops , narrowly escaping a pack of nasty baboons , he slips and slides like a daredevil snow boarder or star surfer riding the big wave . \\nyour eyes can barely keep up ; it's a fantastic accomplishment . \\nthe subject matter here is also a notch or two above animation average . \\nthere are important questions raised about tarzan's place in the world , and all are handled exceptionally well by the screenwriters . \\nthere is no shred of doubt left to ponder afterward , which is a surprising plus that i wasn't expecting to find here . \\nsuffice to say , this film will have both adults and children thoroughly entertained . \\nthe grown-up tarzan is voiced by tony goldwyn , who made a name for himself as the `big mean jerk' from ghost . \\ngoldwyn is effective playing someone who's not aware of his world's dangers . \\nglenn close is also memorable as his gorilla mother , and lance henriksen ( from tv's millennium ) is terrific as the silverback father unsure of how to accept the presence of a human child . \\nas the movie's villain , there is nothing particularly special or catching about the character of clayton . \\nit helps that brian blessed supplies his voice with game enthusiasm , but he is nothing compared to james woods' hilarious hades from hercules . \\na burley guy with a big gun who just wants to capture the gorillas does not quite constitute for an all-together noticeable screen presence . \\nstill , this is one great thrill-ride that disney has constructed . \\ni never expected rice burrough's work to be transformed so successfully from live action to animation , nor with so much emotional depth . \\nparents , along with all the kiddies , are going to find much to like in tarzan . \\n\",\n",

\" \\napparently jake sees the ghosts of dead people , but unlike \" the sixth sense , \" this young child isn\\'t the focus of the picture . \\ninstead , tom witzy ( kevin bacon ) , a chicago lineman , is our protagonist . \\njake is his son , and maggie ( kathryn erbe ) , whom has just discovered she is six weeks pregnant , is his hard-working wife . \\none night while at a party with their closest friends , tom convinces maggie\\'s new-age sister , lisa ( illena douglas ) , to try and hypnotize him . \\nit unexpectedly works , and before long , tom is seeing things he wouldn\\'t normally see , including a deceased teenage girl ( jenny morrison ) in his house who happens to have been missing for the last six months . \\nseeking help from lisa , she tells him that , while he was under hypnosis , she told him that after he awoke , his mind will remain clear and free , like an opened door . \\nshe didn\\'t expect it to work , but it did , and the only way to stop it is for tom to somehow find a way to help this girl he sees . \\n \" stir of echoes \" isn\\'t a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination , but in the thick , atmospheric mood it conjures up , it is a terrifically eerie domestic horror-drama , and is not only effective on a technical level , but is impressive in its portrayal of a struggling working-class family . \\nkevin bacon and , especially , kathryn erbe ( 1997\\'s \" dream with the fishes \" ) , are top-notch and exceedingly believable as a loving married couple who nonetheless have their fair share of problems . \\nafter tom is hypnotized and starts seeing ghastly visions , he is completely taken over by his desire to solve this mystery of the disappearing girl whom he has seen lurking in his house , and instead of maggie not being understanding , she instead believes what tom says , and aside from being a little worried by what he is going through , does not try to stop his pursuit . \\nbacon and erbe are not traditional hollywood stars like tom cruise and julia roberts , and therefore , are easier to relate to and always plausible as a struggling couple who have to work overtime at their jobs just to make ends meet . \\nin a masterfully-done , entrancing sequence , tom is hypnotized by lisa , but instead of watching him , we instead see what he sees , starting from his view as he closes his eyes into darkness . \\nlisa tells him to visualize being in an empty movie theater , and so , we , as audience members , are watching a movie screen from inside a theater , which is also showing a movie screen in a theater . \\ntelling him to move closer and closer to the screen as a fuzzy word in black letters pops up on the screen , we begin to float closer and closer to the front of the theater until we see that the word is \" sleep . \" \\nnever before have i seen a hypnotism scene as mesmerizing and brilliantly-construed as this one . \\ntruthfully , this set-piece , and another in which tom wakes up from a nightmarish dream only to quickly discover he is reliving what he has just dreamt , are worth the full price of admission alone , just to see them on the big screen . \\nhaving loads of fun with her small role as maggie\\'s sister , lisa , illeana douglas ( 1995\\'s \" to die for , \" her last great character ) is a delight , but rarely used to her full advantage in feature films . \\nfunny and enjoyably offbeat , douglas gets to utter the best line in the film : while talking to maggie about tom\\'s visions of the girl , she remarks , \" i wouldn\\'t be worried about him seeing another girl , although the fact that she\\'s dead gives one pause . \" \\nalso of note are jenny morrison ( 1994\\'s \" intersection \" ) , who is truly poignant in the last half of the film when we flash back to see what really happened to her missing character , and liza weil , remarkable in 1998\\'s \" whatever , \" as morrison\\'s grieving teenage sister , debbie . \\nif the resolution of \" stir of echoes \" does not live up to its obviously frightful full potential ( and it doesn\\'t ) , what comes before is both involving and appropriately gritty . \\nthe music score , by james newton howard , and unsettling use of whispers and ghostly sound effects , successfully compliment and foreshadow the off-kilter frame-of-mind that tom is put into , and director david koepp proves once again that he is a director with a knack for creating almost unbearably tense situations that revolve around realistically-written characters . \\n \" stir of echoes \" isn\\'t as good as \" the sixth sense , \" but why should it need to be ? \\nboth films are fully capable of standing on their own two feet , and \" stir of echoes \" really is a spinetinglingly good horror film . \\n',\n",

\\nso these are exiles from krypton , which blew up right ? \\nwere they living there before krypton exploded ? \\nhow do you get to \" inner space \" ? \\nthis whole \" inner space \" notion is never explained , particularly in terms of how these people get information from the outside world . \\nhow do they know where superman went ? \\nhow do they know he took the name clark kent and now works at the daily planet ? \\nthese kinds of things frustrate the hell out of me . \\nargo city is kept running by a power source called the omegahedron . \\none day the founder of argo city , zaltar ( peter o\\' toole ) , gives the omegahedron to superman\\'s cousin , kara ( helen slater ) , for use as inspiration in her art . \\nkara uses it to create a bug-like thing which immediately crashes through the layer of \" whatever \" that protects the city . \\nin the chaos , the omegahedron sails out through the opening , dooming the argonians to death . . . \\nin three days time , or something . \\nkara then climbs into a pod which zaltar had designed for interdimensional travel and chases after the omegahedron to save her world . \\nthe power source travels directly to earth and lands in the bowl of dip belonging to a minor-league witch named selena ( faye dunaway ) who , immediately before her dip was ruined , announced her desires to rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel ( peter cook ) . \\nselena somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plans , and she sets out to achieve world domination . \\nselena is unaware of course that kara has also arrived on earth , and that she\\'s arrived as supergirl ( complete with appropriate costume ) . \\nsupergirl emerges from the bottom of a lake when she arrives . \\nok . . . \\nhuh ? \\nwhy does the omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of a lake ? \\nattention movie : explain yourself ! \\ni\\'m sorry , i can only suspend disbelief so much . \\ni can\\'t buy into any of this nonsense just because the movie wants me to . \\nknowing that she needs a secret identity , supergirl basically \" wills \" herself into a school girl outfit ( complete with a different hairstyle ) , picks the alias linda lee and enrolls into school . \\nshe\\'s given her dorm assignment , and who happens to be her roommate ? \\nlois lane\\'s sister , lucy . \\nok , coincidence is one thing folks , but we\\'re getting really contrived now . \\nwhat follows are some generic all-girls school hijinks . . . \\ncomplete with evil bully girls ( mean for no reason , of course ) and even a shower scene ( ! ) . \\nbest moment though comes when supergirl decides to put a bra on over her school uniform and starts stuffing it with socks . \\nat this point i\\'m rapidly wondering why i\\'m bothering with this nonsense . \\nthere is some credit to give to the film however . \\none lengthy and elaborate sequence featuring an \" evil \" bulldozer destroying a small town in search of its \" prey \" is very well done . \\nalso , its commendable to see genders reversed in the film , whereas the women have all the power and the men are merely objects and tools . \\nhart bochner ( die hard ) is particularly fun as kara\\'s love interest , a lovesick landscaper who is under a spell cast by selena ( although he is unfortunately part of one of the film\\'s more ridiculous moments , when he has to be rescued from being tapped by some \" menacing \" bumper cars ) . \\nthen there were numerous little things that bothered me . \\nthe flying effects are never convincing for a moment . . . \\nit\\'s all too obvious that helen slater is hooked to wires . \\ninstead of having her look like she\\'s flying , the filmmakers wanted her to be \" graceful \" , so she poses a lot and does ballet-type maneuvers . \\nalso , who are the first two humans to meet supergirl when she arrives on earth ? \\na pair of truck drivers/rapists who immediately attack her and then meet a \" wacky \" demise . \\nthere is also some rampant product placement in the film , most notably for popeye\\'s , tylenol , and a&w root beer , with the latter actually putting its logo on the t-shirt of one of the rapists ( ? ! ) . \\nfinally , just one word : monsters . \\nfaye dunaway and peter o\\'toole ham it up unmercifully , however when o\\'toole overacts he\\'s entertaining and when dunaway does it she\\'s annoying ( her character actually says the line \" seize them ! \" \\nat one point ) . \\ndunaway\\'s henchmen ( played by peter cook and brenda vaccaro ) fare much better , with vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of ned beatty\\'s otis character from the first two superman movies . \\nhelen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent , naive character she\\'s written to be , as she\\'s able to gaze at flowers and bunnies with the right amount of genuine wonder to make it believable . \\nbelievability aside though , it\\'s still annoying . \\nnow despite all this negativity ( and i\\'m not alone here . . . supergirl is not a well liked nor a well respected movie in many circles ) , leave it to the good people at anchor bay entertainment to actually make people not only interested , but excited about its release on dvd ! \\nthey have released two separate editions of the film on dvd , to the delight of many people ( including myself . . . \\nyet i\\'m still unclear as to why , since this movie is so awful ) . \\nthe first and most widely available dvd release features the international version of the film which runs 10 minutes longer than the print which ran in u . s . theaters . \\nthe movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2 . 35 : 1 , is enhanced for 16x9 televisions , and has been remastered in full thx glory . \\nextras on the disc include : a full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc and \" special project consultant \" scott michael bosco , the excellent 50-minute documentary from 1984 called supergirl-the making of a feature ( dig that workout montage ! ) , 5 trailers , 3 tv spots , talent bios , in-depth storyboards ( accompanied by score from the movie ) , and assorted still galleries . \\nthe transfer on this international version is incredible . . . \\nyou\\'d think you were watching a new release . \\nimages are sharp , colors jump off the screen , and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts . \\nonly some special effects sequences show the wear of time , and there just isn\\'t much that can be done about that ( unless you\\'re obsessive like george lucas ) . \\nthe new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places , however you\\'ll be hearing absurd dialogue and a mediocre jerry goldsmith score ( which is completely unrelated to john williams\\' classic superman theme and sounds better suited for a cannon films\\' golan-globus production ) . \\nthe commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco is a step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries . \\nbosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl and is there with szwarc to ensure that there\\'s no dead air on the track . \\nbosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen , and we learn a great deal more about the film as a result of his participation . \\nalthough , at times you can tell that bosco is looking for a specific response from szwarc , and is surprised when he doesn\\'t get that response . \\nwe learn some fascinating tidbits on the track , most notably the \" almost \" appearance in the film by christopher reeve . \\ngreat detail is given about superman\\'s proposed role in the original script before reeve ( wisely ) dropped out . \\nas it stands , superman is written off early on in the film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission . \\nfor the sake of brevity , i won\\'t even get into that one . \\nszwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds ( and everyone else agreed ) that supergirl needed to stand on its own , replacing the science fiction of the superman films with cutsy \" whimsical fantasy \" nonsense . \\nbosco also points out scenes not in the american release as they come along , claiming that had they been in the original release it would have been a hit at the box office . \\nagain , for the sake of brevity , i won\\'t even get into that one . \\nanchor bay has also released a limited edition ( only 50 , 000 copies pressed ) two-disc set . \\ndisc one contains everything mentioned for the regular release . \\ndisc two features the never before seen director\\'s cut of the film , which runs 138 minutes long . \\nthe additions mainly consist of scene extensions which don\\'t add much of note , except for a few moments which lengthen peter o\\'toole\\'s screen time ( particularly during his latter appearances ) . \\nthe print is rough in spots and the sound is only in mono , but fans of the film won\\'t care . \\none question though . . . \\nshouldn\\'t the director\\'s commentary be on the director\\'s cut of the film ? \\ni\\'d never seen supergirl before i sat down to watch this dvd . \\ni was nine when it was released to theaters , and even then i was smart enough to inform my parents not to take me to see it . \\nso when i popped the dvd into my player and sat down in my easy chair i had no idea what to expect . \\ni knew the film wasn\\'t beloved and i never had any interest in it before , but i was willing to give it a shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc . \\nas the disc began to spin i was rather impressed with the opening sequence , which made me sit up and wonder if my assumptions all this time could have been wrong . \\ncome to find out however it was just the chase digital stereo logo . . . \\nso i slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started . \\nat the end of the film , supergirl flies back into the lake with the omegahedron , and flies back to argo city . \\nugh , i give up . \\ni\\'m surprised i even made it to the end of the film not once , not twice , but three times to review these discs . \\nsupergirl is definitely a terrific dvd package , but a very lousy movie . \\n[pg] \\n',\n",
       "  b\"a silly film that tries to be a black comedy but plays more like lightweight comedy , with its main asset being a beautiful film location along spain's mountainous coastline . \\nhoward pigeon ( jeff goldblum ) is a 40-year-old mineral water salesman who is married for 13 years to a wife constantly nagging him , elizabeth ( mimi rogers ) . \\nafter a surprise birthday party for him , where his wife bawls him out for coming late to his surprise party , he confides to his best friend that he can't stand it anymore , and then tells him his plan to kill her while vacationing in the same barcelona hotel where they spent their honeymoon . \\njeff is going through a severe mid-life crises , worried that he looks older than his age . \\nhe incessantly talks to himself , mostly agonizing over his bitter marriage and chastising himself why he went out with elizabeth for a second time , and then why he married her just because she laughed at his jokes and was attractive . \\nhe stutters and acts like a man who has lost his confidence . \\nthings change on their vacation , as elizabeth makes an effort to be nice while jeff now becomes the grouch . \\nhe nervously rehearses his murder plan in the hotel room . \\nby accident the gun goes off and into the pillow where he imagined elizabeth would be sitting . \\nwhen other hotel guests and staff come to check about the gunshot , he nervously explains that it was the tv . \\nrealizing how unworkable his plan is , he places the gun in the shattered pillow and throws it into the ocean while he waits for elizabeth . \\nbut elizabeth found his behavior odd during the entire trip , and when after a great deal of effort to get a reservation at the hotel's 5 star restaurant he insists on eating in the room , she decides she had enough of him and checks out without telling him . \\nas a result , he goes to the police to report her missing . \\nwhile with the police , a telegram comes from his wife saying she left him and is going away because she wants to be alone . \\nhis boss and all those he works with are sympathetic to him , and he gets a job promotion . \\nbut soon the pillow with the gun is fished out of the water , giving the police cause to arrest him and search his home . \\nthere they find letters he has written incriminating him to the murder . \\nthe police also find out from the hotel staff about the gunshot heard in his room . \\nin jail , things look bad for him . \\nno one believes him , including his friends and lawyer . \\nhis boss fires him and the papers have a field day with the headline story : pigeon : a jailbird . \\nout on bail , he realizes that his only hope is to track down his wife . \\nthrough a call placed on his credit card , he tracks her down to a mountain resort . \\nonce there he learns that she took a hike up the steep mountain and he gets a priest to be his mountain guide after telling him the true story . \\nthe film is watchable just for the antics of the jeff goldblum comic performance . \\nhe is someone coming apart by the seams , while mimi rogers is his perfect foil . \\nit was mostly pantomine humor , with the comedy charged in the changing facial expressions of the characters and the absurdity of the situation . \\na very minor farce that might appeal to the sitcom crowd . \\nthe film just didn't take its situation seriously and the story had many gaps in it , so it had no chance for black humor to develop . \\nit instead played its set-up of the henpecked husband acting out his fantasy strictly for entertainment value to see how many chuckles it could draw . \\n\",\n",
       "  b'synopsis : private detective tom welles is hired by a wealthy widow to uncover the origins of a snuff film owned by her late husband . \\nafter uncovering the authenticity of the film , welles descends into an underground world of perverse pornographers seeking vigilante revenge on the filmmakers . \\ncomments : 8 mm is one of the more disturbing mainstream movies i have seen in a long time . \\nthough it doesn\\'t present a snuff film ( a movie which documents a person\\'s murder for real , usually during or after some form of sexual act ) as explicitly as the cult classic mute witness and violence as shockingly as , say , natural born killers , 8 mm stays in your head long after you see it . \\nit is not fun to watch ; see something else if you get upset by realistic , sadistic violence . \\nthis film\\'s violence and perverse sexuality skirts closely into nc-17 territory . \\nfor those with strong stomachs , however , 8 mm is an intelligent , worthwhile thriller , especially during its second hour . \\nnicolas cage , after a couple ho-hum movies , returns to material which allows him to utilize his strong acting abilities . \\nas tom welles , a private detective and caring family man to a wife and newly-born daughter , cage skillfully and convincingly portrays a decent man whose unwavering energy slowly transforms into obssession and violence as he is pulled into a nightmarish world of underground pornographers and brutal sexual deviants . \\nserving as a guide to this world is joaquin phoenix , who plays a struggling songwriter named max california . \\ncalifornia , despite his name , is a surprisingly intelligent and complex character , and phoenix does a very good job at slowly pulling the audience to sympathy for the character . \\nthe real star of the movie , though , must be peter stormare . \\nstormare played the \" really , really evil guy \" in fargo , and his character , dino velvet , in this movie seems about ten times more evil and unpredictable . \\nhis performance is very chilling . \\n8 mm\\'s success may hardly be surprising . \\nit was directed by joel schumacher , who , hopefully , saw this film as an apology for the absolutely dreadful batman and robin . \\nbefore directing the last two batman duds , however , schumacher was responsible for several well-made horror flicks : lost boys , flatliners , and falling down . \\n8 mm certainly joins the rank of these minor classics and is perhaps most reminiscent of falling down in that both films present an average man who self-destructs before the audience\\'s eyes . \\n8 mm was written by andrew kevin walker , who also penned the academy award-winning thriller seven a few years back . \\nlike seven , 8 mm is full of dialogue which haunts you well after leaving the theater . \\nwelles is searching for answers . \\nhow could anyone possibly drug and then slowly , methodically , sadistically kill a teenaged girl to make a film ? \\nwhen confronting one of the perpretrators at the end , the murderer responds that there are no reasons . \\nhe just enjoys it . \\nthat , walker seems to suggest , is where the real terror lays : not in the crime itself but in the fact that rational motives do not exist . \\na couple minor faults led me to my four-star rating ( five stars is the highest rating i give ) . \\none , i found it a little difficult , early on , to accept the fact that a hardened private detective would get physically disgusted when first seeing a snuff film . \\nyes , snuff is a horrible thing , but a detective of welles\\' caliber has probably encountered awful things before . \\nsecond , some of the clues welles gathers are too convenient . \\nhe discovers , for example , the victim\\'s diary in her private bathroom , despite the fact the the police , the fbi , and her own mother have all investigated the room before . \\nfinally , the closing scene seemed trite and improbable considering the rest of the film . \\ndespite the above criticisms , 8 mm is an engrossing story . \\none of the best scenes in the film occurs toward the end as a crazed welles , who no longer seems like a hero , brutally beats one of the pornographers responsible for the snuff film . \\nhe pulls a gun on the man and , for a relatively long amount of time , struggles to decide whether or not to kill him . \\nhe then leaves the building and calls the victim\\'s mother , in the middle of the night , to basically see if she would support the action . \\nthe entire scene is tense , unpredictable , and emotionally charged . \\nrarely , anymore , do horror films or thrillers provoke suspense in me as 8 mm , with scenes like this , did . \\n8 mm is most certainly not for the faint of heart . \\nthis is a graphic , oftentimes unflinching , look into the darkness which resides in both ordinary and extraordinary people . \\nif you\\'re prepared for a film of this nature , i give it an enthusiastic recommendation . \\n',\n",

       "  b'i\\'m not quite sure what to say about mars attacks ! , which is obviously the work of a deranged genius . \\nwhen tim burton\\'s twisted alien invasion comedy really works , it\\'s breathtaking and hilarious in equal measure . \\nand when it doesn\\'t work , it\\'s just dull . \\ni\\'m not even sure it works more often than it doesn\\'t , but where it counts -- that is , when this gleefully evil invading force from the red planet gets down to the business of blasting us to kingdom come -- mars attacks ! \\nis brilliant . \\nmars attacks ! \\nis based on a rather unsavory series of trading cards released by topps in the 1950s , and it takes its cues from the same sources as this summer\\'s independence day -- old alien invasion flicks , disaster movies , and big-budget special effects extravaganzas . \\nbut unlike independence day , which was a painfully middle-of-the-road appeal to the hearts , minds and wallets of america , mars attacks ! \\nhas a fully developed and very personal sense of wonder about it . \\nthe big difference is that while independence day celebrated the resilience of human beings , mars attacks ! \\nportrays us as the greedy and hapless schmucks that we are . \\nthe title sequence is just splendid -- an incredible swarm of flying saucers rises out of the canals of the red planet and then storms earthward through the solar system in formation . \\nthe spinning metal saucers are dead ringers for the invading forces of movies past , and their first appearance on the big screen in combination with danny elfman\\'s thundering , theremin-driven score is absolutely jaw-dropping . \\nit\\'s so overwhelming that , i swear to you , i had trouble breathing . \\nthe movie lays low for the next 40 minutes . \\nwe get a glimpse of the alien leader , resplendent in a purple-sequined cape , when a television message is broadcast to the people of the world -- naturally , the only way to communicate with earthlings is to preempt our regularly scheduled programming . \\nbut mostly , the first act is spent developing characters , setting up mildly comic situations , and drawing a quirky but dishearteningly drab picture of america according to tim burton . \\nit\\'s a good thing that the most compelling personality in the movie belongs to the aliens , because burton\\'s just not interested in making more than caricatures out of his human stars . \\nanyone who comes to mars attacks ! \\nexpecting to see a lot of one favorite actor is bound to be disappointed -- with few exceptions , these characters are dispatched as the film progresses . \\njack nicholson is a lot of fun as the president of the united states but fizzles as a sleazy las vegas hotel developer . rod steiger does an amusing enough take on dr . strangelove\\'s buck turgidson , glenn close brings some star power to the role of the first lady , and martin short is a presidential aide who meets the martians in the white house\\'s \" kennedy room , \" a secluded nook where he unwittingly tries to seduce an alien dressed up as a big-haired , pointy-breasted sexpot ( lisa marie , the burton flame who played vampira in ed wood ) -- in an earlier scene , it\\'s made clear that the aliens studied human sexuality in the pages of an old issue of playboy . \\nsarah jessica parker hosts her own tv show and michael j . fox is her newsman husband . \\nthe octogenarian sylvia sidney has a funny part as the old woman who cackles , \" they blew up congress ! \" \\nand plays a decisive role in the defeat of the alien menace . \\njim brown and tom jones are the film\\'s vegas-based heroes , and director barbet schroeder ( reversal of fortune ) has a funny cameo as the unfortunate french president . \\nalso on hand and underutilized are annette bening , pierce brosnan , pam grier , lukas haas and natalie portman ( the latter two also show up in woody allen\\'s everyone says i love you ) . \\nthe real stars , of course , are the computer-generated martians , and they\\'re fantastic . \\nwith bare brains glistening atop their grinning skull-faces , round egg-eyes with red pupils darting this way and that , these animated invaders are malevolence incarnate -- joe dante\\'s gremlins are the closest equivalent in recent memory , but burton\\'s little monsters are more inventive . \\nthe film\\'s raison d\\'etre are the scenes of crimes against mankind -- the most famous monuments of the world crumble under the alien assault , easter island is turned into a bowling alley , and the nasty little buggers perform hideous medical experiments on captured humans . \\nthe sheer level of mayhem is staggering , especially when the aliens make their first attack , blasting human beings into iridescent skeletons . \\nparents are urged to pay special attention to the pg-13 rating -- it\\'s earned . \\nthe special effects vary from charming to astonishing to deliciously cheesy , and at least a couple of shots of mass destruction seem to have been engineered specifically in response to independence day , although mars attacks ! \\nwas in production long before that film\\'s release . \\ncinematographer peter suschitzky , who makes the most of wynn thomas\\'s wildly imaginative production design ( thomas helped define the spike lee style ) , actually took time off from his mars attacks ! \\nregimen to shoot crash for david cronenberg . \\ncronenberg\\'s movie will almost certainly be more somber -- it won\\'t be released in the u . s . until early next year -- but mars attacks ! \\nis surely a similarly elegant nightmare . \\nthis is not a nice movie . \\n ( and which studio executive was duped into giving burton $70 million to make it ? ) \\nby setting the film\\'s final scenes in the nearly empty , holocaust-ravaged america that independence day conveniently avoided , burton\\'s invasion epic suggests that the world we\\'ve got may not be worth saving until many of the people on it are dead . \\nthe victims of his invasion are naive , greedy , or disastrously self-absorbed -- and a good thing , too , since the movie\\'s wicked charm is dependent on our ability to take this invasion partly as a wish-fulfillment fantasy . \\nthe surviving cast members are the innocents and the entertainers , who triumph by determining that the alien invaders -- the ultimate elitists -- are actually susceptible to the kitschiest strains of american pop culture . \\nultimately , this messy masterpiece is the year\\'s funniest comedy and a weird , winking affirmation of the power of the people . \\n',\n",

       "  b'there\\'s some movies i enjoy even though i know i probably shouldn\\'t and have a difficult time trying to explain why i did . \\n \" lucky numbers \" is a perfect example of this because it\\'s such a blatant rip-off of \" fargo \" and every movie based on an elmore leonard novel and yet it somehow still works for me . \\ni know i\\'m in the minority here but let me explain . \\nthe film takes place in harrisburg , pa in 1988 during an unseasonably warm winter . \\njohn travolta plays the local big-shot tv weatherman who is idolized by the townsfolk as if he were john travolta himself and not the bumbling russ richards . \\nruss is married to crystal ( lisa kudrow ) , a blonde bimbo if ever there was one in the history of cinema . \\nshe\\'s a selfish , nasty bitch full of lust and desire but somehow she got the job of the lottery ball girl - not exactly the most intellectually taxing job on the market . \\ncrystal\\'s cheating on russ with their collective boss dick ( ed o\\'neil ) , the tv station manager . \\nshe doesn\\'t seem to genuinely like either of them , but it\\'s all she can do in this one-horse town . \\nmuch like \" fargo , \" this movie tells the story of a man who\\'s going broke and has to pull off a huge scam to get rich quick . \\nhe enlists the help of his english friend gig ( tim roth ) , the local stripclub owner who tells him how to fix the lottery . \\nalong the way a subplot involving a two-bit thug named , accurately , \" dale the thug \" ( michael rappaport ) gets mixed up in the process . \\nthere\\'s also a bookie that somehow gets thrown in the mix once the deal goes down . \\ni\\'m not going to elaborate much further on the plot and story because it continues to unwind and take twists and turns you\\'re not expecting . \\nthis is a farce , which is basically a straightforward , adult-oriented comedy but doesn\\'t go as far as a classic black comedy should . \\nwhere as \" fargo \" was sometimes shocking and disturbing while being funny , \" lucky numbers \" is just funny because you can\\'t take these characters in these outrageous situations seriously . \\nit\\'s all a big cartoon basically , but it\\'s funny and i can respect that . \\ntravolta is great in his role and even though he\\'s not a really likable character , he\\'s trying to be a nice guy despite the fact he\\'s a creep . \\nhe\\'s like a gangster with morals who genuinely feels sorry for the guys he has to kill . \\ncrystal is just the opposite , she\\'s constantly arguing and using whatever brain cells she has left to look out for herself . \\nkudrow is perfect in this role since she\\'s spent 8 years on tv as the dim-witted phoebe on \" friends . \" \\nhere is character is basically a very evil incarnation of phoebe . \\ni have to admit i was honestly surprised and pleased by how the plot unraveled and the methods each of the main characters use to try to get their share of the money . \\nlike \" jackie brown , \" ( an elmore leonard adaption ) , the story is about a circle of 10 characters all after the lottery money that has been won illegally . \\nthe screenplay does a fine job in balancing the characters and slowly revealing their motivations and hidden agendas while at the same time keep russ richards the main focus . \\nmore and more characters are introduced and since the film has such an iconic , cartoony atmosphere you can take on faith just what makes the minor characters do what they do . \\nthe ending itself is great . \\nit\\'s surprising and funny and makes you feel good . \\nyou realize this film has packed in about 10 different movies\\' worth of stories into two hours\\' time and didn\\'t fall apart ( although many other critics might beg to differ ) . \\ni liked it , and i could see it again - isn\\'t that what makes a movie good ? \\n',\n",
       "  b'this is one of the worst big-screen film experiences i\\'ve had for a while . \\nwith this film , plus `showgirls\\' and `basic instinct\\' , paul verhoeven has stamped himself as currently one of the worst blockbuster directors . \\nhis celebrated film `total recall\\' was ? i admit ? successfully scripted , but it nonetheless contained directorial flaws . \\nobviously nobody wanted to invest too much money in a production from someone like verhoeven , the result being that much of the special effects in `starship\\' seemed fake . \\nbut not everything bad in the film was the director\\'s fault , even though he was one of the guys who employed the actors . \\nit is surprising that none of the actors received nominations for the razzie awards ( i expected five for the acting categories ) . \\ncasserole vanity devoid , dense ribald , dingy miasma , and jackass bushy are in serious need of acting school . \\nno , they have to pass primary school drama classes first . \\nwhile `total\\' was written well , `starship\\' is purely pathetic . \\nall right , it is supposed to be a fast-paced entertainment film , and you\\'re supposed to turn off your intellect ( completely ) and enjoy the action sequences and special effects ( that is , guts and gore ) . \\nas a matter of fact , i found the activity incredibly boring , a complete waste of more than two hours . \\nhalf of the film was a bad episode of `beverly hills 90210\\' ( dina meyer was in \" beverly hills \" ) , while another quarter was simply nothing ( things like presenting irrelevant information in an irritating way on the web ) , and the rest was a display of humans fighting computer-generated images . \\nthe battles were all the same ? jumping around , shoot or get stabbed ? and on barren planets that only had giant insects . \\nthere weren\\'t even any stunts , which i consider slightly more exciting than pictures running around . \\ni wonder what the insects eat , if there\\'s nothing but them on the planets ? \\nthere is so much laughable treatment in this film , and it is frankly not amusing when jokes are intended . \\nthis type of story is obviously aimed at 10-year-olds , who can\\'t see it anyway because of the violence and some sexuality . \\nbut then , there are always 16-year-olds who have that frame of mind . \\nthe pointless plot begins when johnny\\'s ( vanity devoid ) girlfriend carmen ( richards ) decides that she wants to join the troopers to fight the insects who are throwing asteroids at earth . \\njohnny then signs up as a trooper also , after an overacted argument with his parents . \\nbut there is another girl , dizzy ( meyer ) , who likes johnny and then there is another boy who likes carmen , which results in a love quadrangle , which isn\\'t better , because it means augmented worse-than-stereotyped soap opera , increased bitchiness , and more bad beverly hills + melrose . \\nand the result of this love quadrangle at the end is also rather stupid . \\nanyway , getting back to the thing you might call plot , johnny is too stupid to be a pilot and has to join the infantry , while his girl and the other dude are in the same league . \\ndizzy comes chasing johnny and joins the infantry also . \\nthey then start training , which contains what roger ebert calls ips ( idiot plot syndrome , moments when only an idiot would have made such obvious mistakes ) , then real combat . \\nand guess what ? \\nthat\\'s about as complex as it gets . \\noh , and one of their friends , carl ( neil patrick harris a . k . a . doogie howser m . d . ) , becomes involved in war intelligence , and his abilities at the end are really corny and make me want to spray insecticide on someone for it . \\nhe\\'s my fifth nom for a razzie . \\nthe troopers fight , fall in love , die , kill , and try to act . \\nnaturally , they win , or sort of half-win . \\nof course , in between ( and at the end ) there are soldiers chatting and smiling while carrying grievous wounds caused by bug legs . \\nthe bugs also suffer from ips : why would you release hold of your captive before killing it ? \\nisn\\'t it also amazing that earthlings haven\\'t invented better hand-held weapons by then ? \\nthe only question that remains is why i gave it one star instead of zero . \\nwell , maybe a-quarter ( of a star ) for the originality of the co-sex shower scene and the ( very ) brief moments of suspense , another quarter for copying `zulu\\' and letting the good guys ( the bugs ) win , and half a star for the sucking-out of the brain of one of those people who call themselves actors ( but there should have been more , the troopers deserved to die ) . \\n',\n",

       "  b'sometimes , when i decide to write a short story or a poem , i think of a title first , and then think of a subject to go with it . \\nit seems that the makers of disturbing behavior had a similar train of thought when it came to the title sequence . \\ni wouldn\\'t be surprised if a couple of guys got together and created the opening credits , and then someone saw it and made up a story to go along with it . \\nthe title sequence is so good , so ominous and original , that it had me engrossed before the picture even began . \\nof course , my attention dwindled shortly into the film . \\ndisturbing behavior , like so many thrillers , starts off interesting and ends up laughably ridiculous . \\nit\\'s a teen horror film with no interesting violence or sex . \\nit\\'s a suspense film with no suspense . \\nit\\'s an evil small town story with no story to speak of . \\nit\\'s a disaster , a listless and uninspired disaster , that just barely misses one-stardom because of a few good sequences , a mercifully short running time , and one terrific set of opening credits . \\nour main man is a fellow named steve clark , blandly played by jimmy marsden . \\nhe moves to a small town with his family after , tragically , his brother shoots himself . \\nsteve is very upset about the untimely death of his brother ; we learn this through strange home-video like nightmares that he has occasionally . \\nthe big trial for steve is , of course , to fit in at school and make new friends . \\nmarsden looks like your stereotypical jock down to the last detail , so he seems a poor casting choice for a social reject . \\nas a social reject , he falls in with some pretentious dope-smoking philosophers , gavin ( nick stahl ) and rachel ( katie holmes ) . \\ngavin informs steve that the local group of jocks , known as the blue ribboners , are actually a bunch of zombies , assimilating new members into their group , while sporadically killing innocent people . \\nso , it\\'s up to our group of mismatched protagonists to 1 ) solve the mystery , and 2 ) do something about it . \\nby the end of it all , something has happened and things have been explained , but the film still doesn\\'t make any sense . \\ndisturbing behavior was written by scott rosenberg . \\ni\\'ve seen his name around recently ( he was one of the toucher-uppers on the armageddon script ) , and i imagine that , for the most part , he knows what he\\'s doing when it comes to screenwriting . \\nhe did , however , have a complete lapse in judgement when he got the idea for this film , and then decided to actually take the time to write it out . \\nevil small town films are pretty common ( the last one , phantoms , is also a dismal failure ) , but it takes a lot of skill to make the formula work . \\nrosenberg\\'s script is a complete mess , lacking in even the most basic attempts at characterization . \\nand it makes no sense , nor is their any purpose when things are finally \" explained . \" \\nthere is supposed to be an element of surprise when we see what is happening to the jocks , but the film never explains exactly what * is * happening . \\nthey get strapped to chairs , a microchip is inserted into their eyes , and -- poof -- they become sex-crazed , superviolent , machine-like creatures . \\nthe doctor responsible for all this , dr . caldicott ( bruce greenwood ) , must be pretty nuts for thinking that this kind of behavior is a step up from the way high school jocks actually behave ( or , perhaps , this is the only realistic element in the film ) . \\nmuch of the writing is simply bad , and rosenberg has no intuition when it comes to the way high school kids act . \\nin one terrible scene , gavin explains to steve all of the high school cliques , while pointing them out in the cafeteria . \\nup front , i should say that , in four years of high school , i did not eat in the cafeteria even once . \\nthat aside , the various social groups he points out are general , uninteresting , and poorly-shown . \\nfor instance , he points to the \" nerds , \" who are all wearing glasses and playing with their laptops . \\nit\\'s such an obvious cliche that i can\\'t believe rosenberg even bothered . \\nmost of the dialogue is forced ( no one says , \" bite me ! \" \\nanymore ) , and none of the scenes have any degree of wit . \\nthis picture is not inspired , and most scenes flop from one to the other , with no sense of momentum or energy . \\nthe blame for this can be placed on director david nutter , who apparently likes his films dry . \\nhorror films should at least exploit violence , but this one is shockingly timid . \\nthere are a few good scenes , though , such as an interesting trip through an insane asylum ( this is , however , the most forced scene in the film , for how our heroes get there or why they bother are things we never learn ) . \\ni also liked the school janitor character , played by william sadler . \\nhe has a few lines that are surprisingly thought-provoking . \\nthe acting is largely a waste of talent . \\nmarsden is , as i said , bland ( thought not particularly bad ) . \\nbruce greenwood is shamelessly wasted . \\nstahl and holmes both show they have talent , but the direction isn\\'t good enough to hone in on their skills ( stahl\\'s performance seems more like a parody of high school potheads ) . \\nnone of these characters expand beyond their one dimension , and , frankly , watching cardboard cut-outs of human beings run down hallways while screaming just isn\\'t all that cool . \\ndisturbing behavior is a wreck of a film , and it started out a wreck before shooting even began . \\ni\\'m surprised there were producers who read this script and thought that it would make a good film , or that it would make a lot of money at the box office . \\nit\\'s not boring , or even blatantly awful , but it\\'s an uninspired lump of a film . \\nit sure starts off nicely , but the regression into total absurdity is so consistent that the very last scene is outright laughable . \\nso , if you go to see this film , take my advice : appreciate the credit sequence , and pray it never ends . \\n',\n",

' \\nno doubt , they were impressed with judd's series of catwalks and disguise changes . \\nthe major problem with `eye of the beholder' is that the film jerks forward , always unsure of its ultimate destination . \\nif it was a thriller , there was little to keep us entranced . \\nif it was a love story , there was absolutely no emotional pull . \\ncompletely disjointed in structure , it's only saving grace was its stylish look which reminded me of my favorite car commercial ( the one where the `6' on the tachometer dissolves into a winding road and a passenger rail car dissolves into a small miniature on a child's train set ) . \\ni am also still hopeful that ashley judd will find a serious role to showcase her potential talents . \\nbeyond that , the film is hopelessly out-of-control and is in need of seriously better traction and handling . \\n\",\n",

       "  b'a disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of two famous 19th century french poets . \\nthe film managed to remove all the poetry from the poets and instead concentrated on their abrasive personalities . \\nthe result is merely an academic exercise , leaving an emotional vacuum that it couldn\\'t build on to show them as the poets they were . \\non paper , this shouldn\\'t have been so terrible -- it had a talented director in agnieszka holland ( \" the secret garden \" ) , a proven screenwriter in christopher hampton ( dangerous liaisons ) , and a capable cast . \\nbut the film was done in by its inept script , the unappealing way the film was directed , and the miscasting of leonardo dicaprio as rimbaud . \\ni found his performance to be the most risible one in the film , with him acting more like a teenage brat than a young genius , spouting obsenities without giving a hint that a true poet lies behind that facade . \\nhe , especially , looked bad because david thewlis as paul verlaine looked so good despite the turgid dialogue that was thrust upon him and how thin a character he was forced to be . \\nbut when the two of them were together , it looked like a mismatch . \\nleonardo\\'s rimbaud only made the young poet look petulant and crude , yet we know from rimbaud\\'s poetry , that he must have had something going for him because his poetry was awe inspiring . \\nthe film opens in post-revolutionary france in 1871 , the 16-year-old rimbaud has sent the established symbolist poet verlaine a letter with his poems . \\nhe accepts verlaine\\'s praises and invitation to be a house guest in his splendid paris home , and rimbaud leaves his sullen farm in rural charleville . \\nonce there , rimbaud is disappointed in the bourgeoisie household , has an immediate conflict with verlaine\\'s busty 18-year-old wife mathilde ( romane ) , and finds to his regret that the drunken verlaine loves his rich wife for her body and that he lives off her family\\'s money , even though he has nothing else in common with her . \\nwhen verlaine states , \" poets can learn from one another , \" rimbaud replies in a haughty tone , \" only if they\\'re bad poets . \" \\nhe will continue to treat the older poet like dirt for the rest of their relationship . \\nverlaine proves to be weak-willed , beating his wife regularly , and plays just as despicable a character as rimbaud . \\nwhen mathilde\\'s father kicks rimbaud out of the house , verlaine finds him in a rooming house and the two become lovers . \\nit\\'s a real downer to watch this story unfold into a series of obnoxious behavior patterns on the part of the two poets , which leads them to traveling together and mathilde asking for a divorce . \\nin brussels , verlaine gets arrested for sodomy and spends two years in jail . \\nwhile rimbaud becomes angered at the literary world and never writes another poem after he becomes 19 . \\nhe instead goes to north africa and becomes an adventurer and a gun-runner , and after ten years there , comes home with a tumor on his knee and dies a changed man at the age of 37 . \\nthe hopeless relationship between the two is what the picture covers in detail and that was not very satisfying . \\nthe film ends on a whimper . . . with \\nverlaine talking with rimbaud\\'s sister about her brother and the poems of his he still possesses , which the sister wants destroyed so as not to embarrass the family or ruin the name of her deceased brother if published . \\nthis film was especially annoying because rimbaud\\'s poems are filled with a visionary tenseness that are not even approached in this film , as the film only manages to skim the surface of the lives of these poets and completely ignores the value of their poetry . \\ni have no idea what the filmmaker was trying to say in this film , but whatever it was , it just didn\\'t work . \\nit certainly didn\\'t bring any light into understanding what rimbaud meant to modern poetry and why he earned the reputation as the so-called father of modern poetry . \\n',\n",

       "  b'there is a striking scene early in \" city of angels , \" where all the angels who live unseen in our midst , gather at the beach to watch the sun rise . \\nthe camera moves above them , showing the endless rows of ethereal men and women , all garbed in black . \\nthen the camera moves in on the face of seth , an angel played by nicolas cage , and as the sun rises , he smiles and his entire face lights up . \\nyou see , the angels can hear music in sunrises and sunsets , but they cannot feel a human touch . \\nit is an important scene for several reasons . \\nfirst of all , it is one of many instances in the film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible . \\nthe film presents these fantastic beings as normal-looking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth , watching what goes on with little interference . \\nthere are none of the standard , hokey angel references used in recent films like \" angels in the outfield \" ( 1994 ) or \" michael \" ( 1996 ) . \\nthe angels here are stark and believable . \\nthis early scene on the beach is also an important scene of juxtaposition , for its shows how god\\'s angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human cannot , and yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures , like feeling the sand on their feet or the waves lapping at their legs , or the smell of the salt in the air . \\nthere is an inherent tragedy in being an angel , although there is much beauty in it as well . \\nthey eternally walk the earth , listening to our thoughts , touching us in our pain , and leading the dying to heaven . \\nlike human existence , being an angel is often confused and unsure . \\n \" city of angels \" is essentially a love story , between seth and a human , a beautiful but sad heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan ) . \\nhe first sees her when he is in her operating room , waiting to lead the soul of her dying patient to heaven . \\nmaggie is distraught , doing everything in her power to stop the man from dying on her table , and seth is moved by her efforts and , more importantly , her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies . \\nangels have the limited power to soothe humans in time of misery and pain , and seth does what he can with his invisible touch , but it\\'s not enough . \\nhe wants to be with her and share her pain , not just stand back at a distance . \\nhe learns that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love and touch is for him to \" fall \" and become human . \\nhe learns this from another fallen angel , played by dennis franz ( \" n . y . p . d . \\nblue \" ) in a touching and humorous performance . \\nsitting at a diner together , franz tells cage\\'s character about how wonderful it is to be human - to be able to taste food , feel another person\\'s skin , smell the air , and most importantly , have a loving wife and children . \\nof course , there is pain to go along with all this , but for seth , it will be worth it . \\n \" city of angels \" is something of a reinterpretation of wim wender\\'s haunting 1988 film \" wings of desire . \" \\nwenders\\' film was more like a poem - it was the feeling , the emotion that truly mattered over what actually happened . \\nthe americanized version moves the location from divided berlin to broken los angeles , and the emphasis shifts onto the relationship between the immortal angel and the mortal human . \\nand , unlike most foreign films that are re-made into hollywood fare , it doesn\\'t suffer extensive damage . \\nthis may be because director brad silberling ( \" casper \" ) and screenwriter dana stevens ( \" blink \" ) wanted to make \" city of angels \" its own movie - inspired by \" wings of desire , \" but not an attempt to copy it . \\nand yet , \" city of angels \" is not a typical hollywood movie . \\nit is beautifully filmed in lush colors by cinematographer john seale ( \" the english patient \" ) , whose sweeping aerial shots and golden lighting make los angeles into an almost unrecognizable new world . \\nseale creates many striking visuals : in addition to the beach scene , there is a wonderful sequence in a circular library where all the angels appear at banisters all around , looking down at seth as he watches maggie walk by . \\nwhile the film travels along a charted plot , it takes time to develop its characters and situations ; it sheds light on the boundaries between what is earthly and what is heavenly , and shows just how thin those boundaries are . \\nboth cage and ryan give soulful , soft-spoken performances . \\nryan , who is usually so bouncy and energetic , truly embodies a sadness that can only be alleviated by a heavenly touch . \\ncage projects all his desire and longing to be human in simple , heartfelt gazes , and speaks with the comforting , knowing voice that only an angel could have . \\nwhat is most striking about \" city of angels \" is that stevens has added a new ending to the screenplay , which is both unexpected and challenging . \\nit\\'s not a formulaic hollywood ending , because it is both sad and uplifting at the same time . \\nit doesn\\'t give the audience what it thinks it wants at the end of a romance . \\ninstead , it offers something much better , something that speaks to the depths of what it means to be human and alive . \\n____________________________________________ visit \" charlie don\\'t surf ! \" \\nan eclectic collection of film reviews by james kendrick http : //www . bigfoot . com/~jimkendrick \\n|| e-mail : jimkendrick@bigfoot . com \\n',\n",

       "  b\"when a film is produced on a shoestring budget by a couple of hardworking filmmakers and when it tells the story of a genuine tragedy , the easy path for a reviewer who hated the movie is to give it a pass . \\ntoss out your usual objectivity , ignore how many times you checked your watch while viewing it , forget how unbearable it was to sit through , and find some meaningless way to compliment it . \\nthis , of course , will be of no service to your readers , but at least you'll avoid the hate mail from the movie's fans . \\nthus it is with a heavy heart that i review the movie paulina ( not to be confused with the recent movie paulie about a talking parrot ) . \\ndirected by vicky funari as a labor of intense love - she spent the last one third of her life on film - the movie blends documentary footage with historic and fanciful recreations to relate the bitterly sad and true story of paulina cruz suarez . \\npaulina was a maid in vicky's household when vicky was young . \\ni got to learn the film's background when i attended a screening in which the two women who made it were present . \\nfor those without such context , the reaction to the film may be that it is a parody of a bad indie film . \\nthe acting is amateurish , the story is maudlin , and it has all the visual appeal of a bad home movie . \\ngrainy and overexposed , the movie , shot on 16mm film and videotape , has little to recommend it . \\nconfusingly composed , the movie jumps about jarringly as it tells its story . \\nquite bloody at times , the story , full of horrific images , seems designed to shock and repulse us . \\nwhy else would you include a scene with a completely nude and bloody 8-year-old paulina ? \\nanother scene has a teenage paulina being fondled on a bus by the man sitting next to her . \\nin retaliation , she bites off part of his finger . \\nthis covers the both of them in a bucket of blood . \\nthe passengers on the bus then view the girl in their minds as everything from saint to sinner . \\none , for example , sees her as an aztec priestess holding out a large heart that she had just cut from a body . \\nthe lugubrious tale has paulina being raped and beaten . \\ncertainly she had to endure a miserable life . \\nbut that does not guarantee that a movie about her will necessarily being good . \\ni felt trapped in the theater watching it . \\nonly the opportunity to talk with the filmmakers afterwards made the movie bearable . \\npaulina runs 1 : 28 . \\nthe film is in spanish with english subtitles . \\nit is not rated but would be an r for violence and nudity and would be acceptable for older teenagers . \\n\",\n",

       "  b'i think maybe it\\'s time for the batman series to be put to rest . \\nnot only has the first two films\\' unsettling insight into what it would really take for someone to make himself into a \" superhero \" been abandoned , but this one throws any lingering realism out the window and goes for all-out camp with few traces of the self-mocking restraint of the relatively light-hearted third installment . \\nlet me give you an example : in the first scene of the movie , batman ( george clooney ) and robin ( chris o\\'donnell ) are summoned to a museum that has been literally turned to ice by mr . freeze ( arnold schwarzenegger ) in an attempt to steal a diamond . \\nmr . freeze\\'s thugs are armed with none other than hockey sticks , but this is no problem for our heroes : automatic skates shoot out of their shoes , at which point robin manages to get hold of a hockey stick , grabs the diamond , and stick-handles it through the museum . \\ni might have expected this from an airplane-style farce , but i don\\'t think that\\'s what this movie is supposed to be . \\nafter all , the previous three batman movies were actually fairly realistic by the standards of the superhero/action genre and kept the corny death-defying stunts to a minimum , while playing the obligatory cheesiness with at least some amount of irony . \\nnot any more ; the list goes on and on in this one . \\nrobin holds onto the outside of a flying rocket ship 30 , 000 feet high in the atmosphere , climbing in the door to save batman . \\nmr . freeze and poison ivy ( uma thurman ) leap from a skyscraper and survive by landing in a small pond . \\na world dominating mad scientist lives in a fortress that seems to have been stolen from the old he-man cartoons . \\nmy very favorite example is the scene in which batgirl ( alicia silverstone ) gets in a race with motorcycle thugs , during which they come up with the clever notion of dousing the road with gasoline and setting it on fire to distract her . \\nnot bad , but wouldn\\'t the police ( or maybe batman ? ) \\nnotice if the road was on fire ? \\ni knew gotham city was this crazy anarchic place , but . \\n . \\n . \\n . \\nit also seems that the creators of the batman movies are obeying some unwritten rule that there have to be more main characters and plot lines in each successive installment . \\nas if three protagonists and two villains weren\\'t enough , batman and robin further weighs itself down with an underdeveloped side story of the failing health of bruce wayne\\'s butler alfred ( michael gough ) , which might have seemed poignant if it wasn\\'t surrounded by so much silliness , as well as several scenes with elle macpherson as bruce\\'s girlfriend which serve no purpose other than to remind us that she is in the movie . \\nall this might be semi-excusable if the story were interesting and entertaining , but it isn\\'t . \\nin fact , it\\'s kind of boring . \\nmr . freeze and poison ivy pale in comparison as villains to past baddies such as jack nicholson\\'s joker and danny devito\\'s penguin . \\ntheir evil plot is as predictable ( schwarzenegger actually pronounces the words , \" today gotham city , tomorrow the world ! \" ) \\nas it is lame-brained ( didn\\'t it ever occur to poison ivy that freezing the entire world would kill her precious plants too ? ) . \\nand robin\\'s constant challenging of batman mostly just makes him look bull-headed and stupid and makes us wonder why batman ever would have taken him on as a partner in the first place . \\nstrip away the stars , the fancy set design , and the status as a \" batman movie , \" and all you have here is another barely passable summer action flick . \\n',\n",
       "  b'since 1990 , the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style . \\nnow , instead of emphasizing feel-good stories replete with characters of noble virtues , the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow . \\nthis realist tendancy can be inspiring at times , as 1993\\'s schindler\\'s list shows . \\nmost of today\\'s mainstream drama , however , creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience . \\nthat\\'s why pictures like october sky , which are a throwback to the good ol\\' dramas of yesteryear , are such a welcome relief in contemporary cinema . \\nthe movie is based on the true story of homer hickam ( jake gyllenhaal ) , a teenager in the 1950\\'s company town of coalwood , west virginia . \\nit\\'s a well-known fact that the only boys to make a name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships ; the rest grow up to work in the coal mine . \\nthe mine , which is run by homer\\'s father ( chris cooper ) , is not the place for homer , however . \\nafter watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in 1957 , homer feels a connection with the outside world -- as he puts it , \" anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing i did . \" \\ndrafting two of his best friends and the brainiac outcast , homer begins to construct rockets . \\nwith the help of their history teacher , miss riley ( laura dern ) , and several mine workers , the four are soon bound for great things . \\noctober sky is a skillfully crafted film , and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston . \\njohnston -- whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing well-known titles like jumanji and the rocketeer down to an uncredited role as a death star trooper in star wars -- certainly knows what he\\'s doing here . \\nhe molds characters which are true to life and also fun to watch into a plot that is straightforward and robust . \\nhe does not push any barriers , but instead adopts a conservative style of filmmaking which enhances the film\\'s charm . \\nhis finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be lost -- such as the relationships between homer and various mine workers , or the silent struggle between homer\\'s mother and father . \\nthe cast is well chosen , although the true bright spots are the supporting roles . \\nlaura dern ( jurassic park ) lends a strong performance in the role of the history teacher , giving the boys the support and guidance they need . \\nher role is instantly likeable . \\nchris cooper ( the horse whisperer ) , as homer\\'s father , is less likeable -- even downright despicable at times -- but his turn here gives gravity to the movie . \\nhe\\'s definitely a driving force in homer\\'s life , and his more humane moments give the piece a certain dynamic that is commendable . \\nthe script is generally cheerful , projecting the boys\\' endeavors in a lighthearted manner . \\nthere are moments when it becomes predictable -- such as the train tracks scene -- and there are moments when it sacrifices orginality for the need to come up with an emotional plot twist . \\nit highlights the essence of youth , however , and for its exceptional job at this it can be forgiven other missteps . \\noctober sky should be a success with audiences . \\nalthough it doesn\\'t have the appeal of current teen flicks like varsity blues or she\\'s all that , it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean towards . \\nit\\'s a welcome change to the dramatic genre , and one that everyone should see . \\n',\n",

       "  b'seen september 5 , 1998 at 10 p . m . at the sony nickelodeon theaters ( boston , ma ) , theater #2 , with matt perreault for free using my sony/loews critic\\'s pass . \\n[theater rating : * * 1/2 : okay seats , sound , and picture] \\nmodern society is now inundated with more sex and sexuality than it ever has been before , from teenage sitcoms to nc-17-rated films about fetishes . \\nthe biggest debate of the subject is whether or not it affects reality or just reflects it . \\n \" your friends and neighbors \" takes a different approach as it\\'s a film that revolves almost entirely around sex and how can be used for both pain and pleasure even within a small circle of friends . \\none of the most important aspects of the film that most be noted and analyzed before the film can really be dissected as a whole is writer/director neil labute\\'s basic setup and some of the unique methods he employs to tell the story . \\nfirstly , and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex , detailed story of lust , betrayal , arrogance , hypocrisy , greed , and just plain stupidity between six different characters ( three men , three women ) , without hardly any supporting characters , ( a few have a line or two ) , mostly extras . \\neverything they do will somehow affect another character and ultimately come full-circle back to themselves , whether it be positive or negative . \\nbut to just state this is arbitrary , and explaining and criticizing the process is difficult . \\nlabute\\'s ability to tell his story through a few characters is a remarkable feat , but what\\'s specifically impressive is the fact the characters\\' names are never revealed until the end credits roll . \\nfor the sake of this review , i will describe the characters and refer to them as their main characteristic . \\nanother interesting accomplishment is the fact every scene takes place inside with limited focus . \\nwe\\'re always able to tell where the characters are ( someone\\'s home , the gym , a restaurant , hotel room , etc . ) , but what the city they live in , what year it is , what the society is like , etc . is relatively unknown . \\nthe film is a complete character study with the tight , intense drama of the theater . \\nno one plot dominates the story , which makes the first act a bit tedious for its lack of background . \\nwe\\'re simply dropped in on the characters\\' lives and are expected to figure out the rest . \\nthe characters are a group of middle-class white people who are all successful at what they do , but they\\'re only concern right now seems to be their sex lives . \\nfirst there\\'s barry ( eckhart ) and mary ( brenneman ) , a married couple who are going through a dry spell not unlike many other couples in other situations who don\\'t know what they\\'re problem is . \\nbarry is kind of a dorky businessman who loves his wife , and the sex they have , but doesn\\'t have a lot of ambition - he just follows everyone else . \\nmary is a writer of some sort , but lacks aggression and emotion like her husband and is the meekness character , but ironically , doesn\\'t hesitate to commit adultery just to feel something . \\nlabute\\'s script does a good job in characterizing mary and barry as individuals , but is very light on chemistry and connection between the two . \\nobviously , this is the theme , which is enhanced by the actors\\' good performances , but at the same time seems just a bit hollow . \\nanother couple is jerry ( stiller ) and terri ( keener ) who live together and seem to have been involved with each other for a long time , yet they constantly argue over anything and everything . \\ntheir sex life is also fraught with problems and for some reason they continue to do it throughout their infidelitous relationship . \\nif only one aspect of the film could use improvement , it would be this area . \\nit\\'s natural for a married couple to become bored with each other , but why would two people who can barely stand each other continue to have sex and live together ? \\nwhat did they ever see in the other person to begin with ? \\nlabute never really answers , but since the film is more concerned with the payoff than the process , it still makes for good drama , tension , and manip ulation so intricate and deceitful it\\'s fascinating . \\ntwo other characters act as catalysts , cary ( jason patric ) and cheri ( natassja kinski ) . \\ncary is an arrogant , hostile sex-maniac who defines the word \" bastard . \" \\nsomehow he is able to bend women to his will , either through charm or just attitude , into getting his way . \\nhe\\'s the kind of guy everyone should stay away from as we realize he\\'s secretly perverted , but somehow barry finds comfort in his company , although jerry is always nervous around him . \\npatric gives an outstanding performance , so much so that we want to know more about him despite how intimidating and unlikable he is . \\ncheri is a character labute uses as a catalyst to see how the other characters react to her . \\nshe works in an art museum and at some point throughout the film , each character will engage her in almost the exact same conversation and her reaction is always different , from becoming involved in a relationship with one , to brushing it off as small talk with another , to being outright appalled by yet another . \\nshe\\'s a sweet woman , perhaps the most normal of any of the characters , and although her symbolism is obvious , her role as the outsider is the most relatable . \\ni will not reveal who cheats on who and how each character is specifically affected by the others\\' action , as that\\'s the hook of the film . \\nthe first two acts begin to set up the characters and each\\'s scenarios , but it\\'s often difficult to tell what they will do about it and with whom . \\nthe result is sometimes surprising , other times predictable , but the actual course of actions is always fascinating . \\nfor a while everyone has their fun , but ultimately each character\\'s guilt , attitude , or ignorance will disserve them . \\none of the most important things to note is how realistic the story is supposed to be . \\nsince the characters only interact with each other there isn\\'t much pop culture references , as almost everything has a deeper philosophy behind it . \\nare we to assume that these people are , as the title states , our friends and neighbors ? \\ni don\\'t know of anyone going through the same situations as these people . \\noften times the film is not unlike a network melodrama , other times situations are like those not seen outside a porno movie . \\nbut what this film does have that the others don\\'t is repercussions in the end . \\nalthough the film creates its own reality , it goes to show that even the immoral aren\\'t immortal . \\nin what way \" your friends and neighbors \" is supposed to work is open to interpretation . \\nit definitely has a lot to say about the price that comes with infidelity , but it could have been even better had it expanded on that theme more specifically . \\nstill , it\\'s an accomplishment in film-making because it has put a timeless theme into a modern perspective . \\n',\n",
       "  b'life is beautiful is a rare treat : a lighthearted comedy that tackles a very serious subject without committing the sins of being disrespectful , or , even worse , humorless . \\nit combines a charming romance with a dash of farce , stirs in a little poignancy , and ends up a very enjoyable movie . \\nit\\'s an italian film , but don\\'t let that discourage you . \\nsubtitle-phobes will be missing a wonderful experience . \\nlife is beautiful opens as a sweet romantic comedy , with the clownish , but good natured guido ( roberto benigni ) arriving in a rustic italian town to work as a waiter for his uncle . \\nthe year is 1939 , and guido literally stumbles into the girl of his dreams , dora ( nicoletta braschi ) . \\ntheir romance seems to be picture perfect , with only one stumbling block : she\\'s already engaged to another man . \\ncan guido overcome the odds and win his girl ? \\nwhat do you think ? \\nhowever , five years later , things have taken a turn for the worse in italy . \\nthe fascists have stepped up their race initiatives , which is bad news for the jewish guido and his new son giosue ( giorgio cantarini ) , who are rounded up and shipped off to a concentration camp . \\nunable to protect his boy in any other way , guido attempts to shield his young son from the horrors of the labor camp . \\nhe pretends that everything is all an elaborate game , with points awarded for such tasks as hiding , being brave and being very very quiet . \\nas you can tell from the description , life is beautiful has two very different tones , but manages to excel at both of them . \\nas a romantic comedy , it is sweet and funny . \\nas a bittersweet tale of hope amid despair , it is touching . \\nroberto benigni\\'s work here has been compared with some of the best of chaplin\\'s , and it is easy to see why . \\nhe is able to run the gamut of comic expression , from slapstick to farce , with a warm-hearted feeling that celebrates his downtrodden hero\\'s \" triumph of the underdog \" spirit . \\nlife is beautiful treads a thin line when it turns its attentions to the holocaust . \\nhowever , it is able to successfully navigate the minefield , without demeaning the gravity of the horrors involved , nor without losing its humorous edge that allows you to smile through the tears . \\nwith life is beautiful , benigni has created a triumphant , but bittersweet comedy . \\nit\\'s quite simply one of the most enjoyable times i\\'ve had at the movies this year . \\n',\n",
       "  b'why do so many children\\'s films treat their target audience with utter contempt ? \\ntoo many of those who write or direct for children\\'s movies assume that the kids just can\\'t handle serious , thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues . \\n \" the iron giant , \" which was directed and co-written by brad bird , late of such animated series as \" the simpsons \" and \" king of the hill , \" assumes that not only can children handle such discussions , but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time . \\n \" the iron giant \" holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience , making it a film that\\'s enjoyable for both children and adults alike . \\nhogarth hughes ( voice of eli marienthal ) is a spirited young lad who lives with his hard-working single mother , annie ( jennifer aniston ) , in a small town in maine . \\nafter staying up late and watching scary movies on a night his mother is away , hogarth treks out into the forest to investigate what has stolen his antenna and ruined his tv reception . \\nhe comes across a giant robot ( vin diesel ) from space that eats metal for food . \\nafter saving the robot , nicknamed the iron giant , from electric shock , hogarth befriends the creature and takes him in as a pet of sorts . \\nbecause of damage he suffered upon landing , the giant has forgotten what his original mission was , so he just follows hogarth around like a lost puppy . \\nrealizing he can\\'t just keep the giant in a barn all the time , and that the giant needs food , he takes him to a junkyard owned by dean ( harry connick jr . ) , an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time . \\nit soon becomes apparent that dean and hogarth can\\'t keep the giant a secret forever , because a government spook named kent mansley ( christopher mcdonald ) has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area and considers the giant a threat to national security . \\nhe suspects hogarth knows something about the giant , and takes up residence in hogarth\\'s house as a lodger . \\nmeanwhile , the giant begins to exhibit ominous behavior that suggests he was built to be a weapon of some kind . \\n \" the iron giant \" is exactly what family films ought to be , because it doesn\\' t talk down to its audience . \\nthe story is simple , very simple , about an alien being that drops out of the sky and befriends a young boy . \\nit\\'s very similar to the spielberg classic \" e . t . , \\' and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of \" the iron giant . \" \\nthe film holds many of the better elements of spielberg\\'s film , such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy . \\nthe film delivers several serious messages , the most important of which is one\\'s ability to choose one\\'s own fate . \\nhogarth teaches the giant to go against his programming and become what he wants to be : a hero . \\nthe final sequence is touching and appropriate , though i won\\'t give it away , i will say that very few will be disappointed . \\nthe animation , while not up to disney standards ( what could be , after \" tarzan \" ? ) , is good enough to make you forget you\\'re watching a cartoon . \\nthe giant is computer-animated , while the human characters are all hand-drawn the old-fashioned way . \\nthe characters\\' faces are done quite well , drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible , but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief . \\nfine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth , and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother . \\nharry connick jr . does a nice characterization as dean , and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney ( of tv\\'s \" frasier \" ) as an army general called in by agent mansley . \\nunlike several cartoon features , each character is actually a developed personality , rather than a stereotype , and is actually integral to the plot , rather than being a superfluous comic-relief sidekick ( a clich ? disney still hasn\\'t ditched ) . \\ndean , for example , could have been a stereotypical beatnik ( his character profile seems to suggest that ) , but he is presented as a character with real emotions , thoughts , and motivations . \\neven the heavy , agent mansley , is not a villain who does bad things simply because he wants to , but out of his own fear and paranoia . \\na lesser animated feature would have drawn up paper-thin stereotypes and figure the kids won\\'t mind , but \" the iron giant \" has clearly put a little work into making the characters real , and it pays off . \\nthe film isn\\'t only around to deliver heavy-handed messages , though . \\nit\\'s also very funny , and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy . \\nthe scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things , such as dive into a pool , are handled well , and director brad bird clearly has a sense of comic timing , having worked on \" the simpsons \" for many years . \\na sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt to \" outlast \" one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed , and also extremely clever . \\nthe film even takes some jabs at america\\'s nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war , satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students that tell them to \" duck and cover \" in the event of a nuclear attack . \\n \" the iron giant \" has much more of a satirical edge to it than most family films , and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing . \\ninstead of seeing people get bonked on the head , we get well-timed , clever gags that seem to have required some imagination to come up with . \\nwhen you get right down to it , \" the iron giant \" is no more than the story of a boy and his robot . \\nthe story is so straightforward , so quaint , that it ultimately becomes charming . \\nthough i enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person , when it comes to family entertainment , simple is the way to go . \\nit\\'s akin to one of those bedtime stories your father told that had you hanging on his every word , but it\\'s not the story that sets the film above others of its kind , but rather the elements that go into the story , namely real characters and thoughtful dialogue , which \" the iron giant \" has in spades . \\n',\n",
       "  b'after indecent proposal and up close and personal , redford was wise to direct himself in a picture at last . \\nredford may look great on-screen , but over the past few years , he\\'s proven himself a bigger talent behind the camera . \\nordinary people is one of the best films of the nineteen-eighties , and it was the first picture he helmed . \\nwhile the milagro beanfield war was only occasionally successful at combining magic-realism with . . . um , \\nrealism , and i\\'ve never been much of a fan of a river runs through it ( to the chagrin of many ) , quiz show was dazzling , energetic and convincing . \\nthe horse whisperer represents both his directorial return to nature films and the first time in that sub-genre redford seems equally concerned with humans and scenery . \\nscott-thomas plays annie maclean , an uptight but respected new york magazine editor whose daughter grace ( johanssen ) loses a leg and a good friend when an early morning ride climaxes with their horses colliding with a semi . \\ngrace\\'s horse survived , but barely , and has gone mad . \\nannie refuses to put the animal out of his misery , believing that if the horse heals it will mend grace\\'s newly-broken spirit . \\neventually , mother and daughter travel alone to montana to be with tom booker ( redford ) , a famed \" horse whisperer \" who has a gift of calming horses with simple looks and touches , leaving busy husband neill behind . \\neventually , they move onto the booker ranch with the rest of tom\\'s family , and annie finds herself falling in love with all things montana , including , naturally , tom , the wise and lonely trainer . \\nthe horse whisperer is delicately made . \\ni dare say lyrical , since to many people\\'s ear , that word is synonymous with boring . \\nhardly . \\nthe horse whisperer has little to offer in the way of surprise , but it does have an honesty that is refreshing and consistently enjoyable to watch , especially in the final third of the story . \\nscott-thomas and johanssen seem like mother and daughter , and you have no doubt believing that the mountain vistas would put these new yorkers under a spell , especially since d . p . \\nrobert richardson\\'s photography casts montana as heaven on earth . \\n ( a gimmicky but effective technique the filmmakers employ is a switch in aspect ratio from squarish to widescreen when the central location shifts from new york to montana . ) \\nthe underrated sam neill turns in perhaps his most heartfelt , emotive performance as the nice-guy husband , who is as authoritive and likeable as tom . \\nhe is indeed a refreshing change from the sexist , lout of a husband so many writers resort to as a short-cut for explaining away the cheating spouse\\'s motivation . \\nunfortunately , one of the horse whisperer\\'s only flaws is the chemistry between would-be lovers scott-thomas and redford . \\ni liked both of them , but i didn\\'t necessarily believe that redford would fall for such a cold fish , even if the countryside air thawed her slightly . \\nluckily ( and curiously ) , this is such a rich and textured movie that it doesn\\'t quite matter-their adultery seems like an afterthought , the obligatory sub-plot that ties many of the characters\\' complex relationships together . \\n',\n",
       "  b'most movies seem to release a third movie just so it can be called a trilogy . \\nrocky iii seems to kind of fit in that category , but manages to be slightly unique . \\nthe rocky formula of \" rocky loses fight/rocky trains/rocky wins fight \" is carried out to the letter . \\nalso the \\'tradition\\' of showing the last five minutes or so from the past rocky film is used as well . \\nthis movie begins with a series of clips showing how famous rocky ( sylvester stallone ) has become . . . \\neven showing a brief appearance on sesame street ! ! \\nthen it moves on with rocky being in a fixed fight with thunderlips ( hulk hogan ) . \\na mysterious bad-ass known as clubber lang ( mr . t ) trash-talks to rocky about his stupid decision to retire from boxing and that he \" pities the fool \" for not coming out and fighting him outright . \\nrocky\\'s trainer ( burgess meredith ) tells rocky not to fight , but the italian stallion doesn\\'t listen . \\nnaturally , he gets his ass kicked . \\nsomewhere along the line after this several things happen . \\nrocky\\'s longtime trainer dies , causing rocky to train with his former opponent apollo creed . \\nrocky\\'s wife complains to her husband that he should fight . \\nthe final fight ensues between clubber and rocky . \\nguess who wins ? \\nthe winner\\'s name rhymes with \\'smocky\\' . \\nthe movie is entertaning mainly because of clubber lang\\'s over the top performance . \\nthe dramatic aspect has been toned down considerably since rocky ii and now action seems to be the strong point of the film . \\nwhich is good if you like fighting scenes . \\nthe last match is quite decent actually . \\nif you liked the previous films , rent this one . \\nit\\'s well worth seeing if you are a fan of the series . \\nbut if you can\\'t stand rocky shouting \" adrianne ! ! ! \" \\none more time , see something else . \\n',\n",

       "  b'few films in 1999 have divided the critical consensus as sharply as alan parker\\'s adaptation of frank mccourt\\'s memoir angela\\'s ashes . \\nmany dismissed it as an humorless , sentimentalized , uninteresting version of the hugely popular novel ; others hailed it as a heartfelt , sincere portrait of the human spirit . \\ni\\'m somewhere in between , leaning strongly towards the latter . \\nit\\'s certainly well-made and it never becomes tedious like some literary adaptations have a tendency to be . \\nbut i have a feeling that parker filled the movie with pseudo-lyrical shots of rain falling on the homely streets of ireland just so it can have the two-and-a-half hour running time that screams \" i\\'m important ! \" \\nmccourt\\'s book of the same name was about him and his family moving from the us to ireland in the early 1900\\'s , a time when most people were desperately trying to get into the us . \\nas he comments , \" we were the only irishfolk to say goodbye to the statue of liberty . \" \\nin ireland , frank ( played by joe breen as a small child ) , his 3 brothers , his mother angela ( emily watson ) and his father malachy ( robert carlyle ) get financial help from angela\\'s mother , a stereotypically strict catholic who chides her daughter for marrying a northern irishman . \\nshe helps them get a rat-infested apartment and malachy goes looking for a job . \\npositions are scarce and when he does finally find one , he is unable to hold on to it because of his fondness for drinking . \\nmeanwhile , frank goes to an uptight catholic school , where the instructors beat students with blunt wooden objects as often as their heart desires . \\ntwo of frank\\'s brothers soon die , crippled by the dreadful living conditions and malnutrition . \\nas if the poverty and the suffering weren\\'t intense enough as it stood , malachy and angela have another baby , worsening the situation further . \\ni imagine this doesn\\'t sound like much of a plot . \\nthat\\'s probably because it isn\\'t one . \\nthese are people . \\nthis is their story . \\ndirector alan parker ( the commitments ) knows how to tell a good story and angela\\'s ashes , despite its relentlessly literary tone remains interesting . \\nthough the film occasionally indulges too much in its gloomily picturesque irish setting , it avoids looking like a glorified travelogue . \\nsupplementing parker\\'s able direction are the engaging , often poignant performances of the leads , some of them seasoned thespians , others relative beginners . \\ncarlyle , the charismatic british actor who has shown astonishing range by hopping from the lead in a rowdy slapstick comedy to the villain in a james bond movie and now to sentimental melodrama , perfectly portrays his rather pathetic character . \\nwe empathize with the guy , but we don\\'t like or admire him . \\nemily watson turns in a heartfelt , sincere supporting performance . \\nit is mostly she who implants that lump in our throats . \\nalso worthy of mention is little joe breen , whose face graces the film\\'s superb poster . \\nit is breen\\'s first feature film and he\\'s extraordinary as young frank . \\nnot unlike sudden oscar darling haley joel osment of the sixth sense , you can peer into the character\\'s soul through breen\\'s sad eyes . \\non the flip side , one thing that could have vastly improved angela\\'s ashes is a more decisive editor . \\nwhile gerry hambling sure makes the most of the scenery , he and parker also leave in at least a half an hour of unnecessary footage . \\nthe first half , especially , could have been trimmed down , bringing the film to a more reasonable running time and doing our bladders a favor in the process . \\nthings pick up at about the halfway point , sort of dismissing a lot of the criticisms i accumulated during the opening hour , but i maintain that the aggressively deliberate pace parker and co . set in the first half was ludicrously unnecessary . \\n * spoiler warning ! \\nskip next paragraph if in suspense ! * \\nthe film\\'s final message is somewhat conflicted , as frankie , in effect , leaves his family famished in ireland while he himself goes back to america . \\nwhat , exactly , are we supposed to make of that ?

       "  b'only a year after the initial release of \" scream , \" the horror send-up from veteran horror director wes craven and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into the slasher genre , the inevitable sequel \" scream 2 \" has arrived in our theaters . \\nwhile the tongue-in-cheek , parodic element is still noticeable in this film , it\\'s really a sideshow to a broader commentary on violence and the media and a more conventional horror story . \\nthe first film , while often violent and gruesome , was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value and the discussion of the quirks and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant . \\nthe premise of \" scream 2 \" is that a series of copycat killings begin when a movie called \" stab , \" based on a book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers ( courtney cox ) about the events in \" scream , \" is released and two audience members are killed during the opening screening . \\ni had heard about this scene before i went to see the film and was surprised to find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy . \\nits conclusion , in which a bleeding , wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think it\\'s a publicity stunt , is more surreal and disturbing than anything else . \\nthe satire in \" scream 2 \" thus takes on a broad focus and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general . \\nalthough resident horror film geek randy ( jamie kennedy ) is back with fresh dialogue about sequels ( and , interestingly enough , how they are usually inferior to their predecessors ) , the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well . \\neverything from \" friends \" and \" saved by the bell \" to \" showgirls \" and \" terminator 2 \" is referenced here ; horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning , and there aren\\'t any \" wes carpenter \" jokes this time . \\nmore importantly , this film portrays characters willing to go to disturbing lengths for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have clearly been warped by what they have seen on tv and film . \\nthe killings are clearly an imitation of the previous murders from \" scream \" ( in fact , the culprit even plans to use the influence of horror movies as a courtroom defense ) , weathers exploits the situation for her own notoriety , and one man seems willing to save the heroine\\'s life only if it will earn him an interview on the today show . \\nunderstandably , \" scream 2 \" does not go so far as to actually blame the movies , but rather shows that those who do imitate horror movies are already sick and twisted . \\ncouple that with the fact that several of the characters , most notably the lead character sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , are fairly well-developed and that there are some genuine moments of spine-chilling suspense , and what we have is a pretty darned good horror movie in its own right . \\nwe don\\'t just get the horror of scary masks and graphic gore - we also get the horror of sympathetic characters who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered ( and , in one case , a significant character who was an audience favorite even bites the dust ) and whose lives have been reduced to constant fear of a crazed murderer lurking around the corner . \\nwhile i have not seen any of his other work , it\\'s easy to see why craven is generally touted as the most sophisticated \" slasher film \" director , as he clearly cares about something more than just the actual acts of slashing . \\nunfortunately , \" scream 2 \" occasionally reverts to the time-honored horror tradition of throwing logic out the window . \\nfor example , several characters seem quite clearly dead and inexplicably turn up alive later - there has been a running gag in both movies about the villain being able to pull off this particular trick , but it also happens with other characters and in an even less believable fashion . \\nthere are also a few scenes in which the killer suddenly appears behind the next victim in a situation such that ( s ) he clearly would have been seen moving in that direction . \\nas for the question of whether or not \" scream 2 \" is yet another sequel not as good as its predecessor . \\n . \\n . \\nwell , it\\'s hard to say . \\ni gave the first \" scream \" 3 1/2 stars as well because it worked pretty consistently as a light-hearted send-up . \\n \" scream 2 \" bounces all over the place stylistically , but it does a better job delivering the genuine scares and asking the questions about media violence that were only hinted at in the first installment . \\ni\\'m not sure which is the better movie , but i did leave the theater convinced of one thing : sequels , however much randy might argue , do not necessarily suck . \\n',\n",
       "  b'what is freedom ? \\nhow does one determine who is free ? \\nin 1839 , those questions were more difficult to answer then they are now . \\nyet , the mistakes of our forefathers must be examined in order to rectify current situations . \\nthat is , in essence , what steven spielberg\\'s gripping drama \" amistad \" is about . \\nthrough its various dramas , spielberg presents a case about a group of africans , who , after being seized from their home , were forced onto a ship and sent to the united states aboard \" la amistad \" . \\non their way there , the slaves , led by cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , rebelled , killing off part of the crew . \\nhowever , the ship was still directed towards the united states , where the africans were brought to trial under murder . \\nin the court , various factions claim ownership of the slaves , and therefore try to seize them away . \\nthe united states government , led by president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) , and secretary of state secretary forsyth ( david paymer ) , try to ship the africans to spain , where an 11 year old isabella ii ( anna paquin ) wants them back . \\nthe two spaniards who own \" la amistad \" want the slaves for themselves . \\nthe american ship that found the slaves also wants them . \\nin the midst of this are two abolitionists ( stellan skaarsgard and morgan freeman ) , who want the slaves to be free . \\nthey enlist the help of lawyer matthew mcconaughey , who tries to free them . \\nthrough various legal proceedings , the case appears before the supreme court , where it is argued by ex-president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) . \\nthe film itself is a visual wonder . \\nspielberg favorite janusz kaminski sets the film in a dark , somber mood when appropriate , and a visual setting when appropriate as well . \\nat times , the film is very slow , and very methodical . \\nhowever , spielberg is not at his finest here , because the courtroom scenes have a tendency to lag . \\nthe film is , in essence , a courtroom drama , one whose events are oversimplified . \\nthe characterization is also weak , displaying weaknesses in building up characters such as the lawyer baldwin ( mcconaughey ) , and especially morgan freeman\\'s abolitionist . \\nbut spielberg\\'s finest work in the film , the opening scene , a scene of cinque\\'s family , and the brutal voyage of the slaves to america , is altogether stunning . \\nit is this emotional force that carries the film . \\nmcconaughey is superb as the lawyer defending the africans , hopkins is sensational as the old adams , freeman is outstanding when used ( spielberg vastly under uses his supreme talents ) , and the rest of the cast is stellar . \\nthe movie , however , belongs to hounsou . \\nhis emotional intensity is brilliant . \\nspielberg manages to make even the slowest scenes sparkle with focus on hounsou , and the film\\'s extraordinary power is simply captivating . \\nthe film is flawed , for most of the supporting characters are merely cardboard . \\nbut that doesn\\'t matter . \\nthe story is a gripping one , and one of extreme importance . \\nkudos to spielberg for finding it , finding the right men for the job , and letting the audience listen to the words of cinque . \\na good job all around . \\n',\n",

without a doubt the loudest , longest , and ultimately most amateurishly written film ever released through a major studio . \\nproducer dean devlin and director roland emmerich should be ashamed of themselves , and as penance be forced to return to film school to watch \" last year at merienbad \" until they can grasp the idea of content and plot . \\nno amount of hype , no amount of money can hide the fact that these filmmakers are the 90s equivalent to william beaudine ( billy the kid vs . \\ndracula ) . \\n \" godzilla \" opens with stock footage of the bikini atoll nuclear tests interspersed with footage of iguanas playfully swimming and nuzzling their eggs . \\nwe are then introduced to the crew of a japanese fish canning ship ( a questionable enterprise considering that tuna processing is supposed to be supervised to eliminate the netting of dolphins ) . \\nwell , the ship is attacked and sunk by an unseen creature . \\nlater , a group of frenchmen led by philippe roache ( jean reno ) interview the sole survivor . \\nin a state of shock , the only thing the man can utter is the word \" gojira \" ( the japanese name of the famed beast ) . \\nwe are then introduced to dr . nick tatopoulos ( matthew broderick , with a moniker obviously taken from the effects designer of the film ) . \\nhe is currently studying the effects that the chernobyl disaster has had on the local earthworm population . \\nhe is immediately drafted by the u . s . military and taken to panama where he is shown the huge footprints of a creature . \\nin a short amount of time , another fishing boat ( loaded with canned tuna from the u . s . and korea for some reason ) is found grounded in jamaica . \\nwell , it seems that whatever is eating these ships is headed for new york . \\nwhen the beast finally appears , he tears up one building , stomps a couple of trucks and makes life hell for the incumbent mayor ebert ( thumbs up for new york ) . \\nthe military , with dr . tatopoulos\\'s help , have two tons of fresh fish dumped in the middle of new york to lure the beast out of its hiding place in the new york subway system . \\nit finally comes crashing through the city streets and has a cute face to face with dr . tatopoulos who snaps the beast\\'s picture . \\nthe monster eats the fish , the military starts shooting , and the chase is on , with the army causing 90% of the ensuing damage . \\nworking from a hunch as to why godzilla has decided to come to the big apple , dr . totopoulos buys a few home pregnancy kits from a local drugstore that has chosen to remain open ( even though new york has been evacuated ) . \\nwell the test proves that the monster is a hermaphrodite and is pregnant . \\nneedless to say , no one believes the good doctor about his discovery , so he must join up with the renegade french secret service agents and find the monster\\'s nesting site and destroy the eggs before the mayor starts letting the populous back into the city ( even though the monster isn\\'t dead yet ) . \\ni sincerely hope that i\\'ve completely spoiled any interest anyone might have of seeing this film . \\ni gave away the relevant plot so that i could spare those of you courageous ( or foolish ) enough to drop down an hour\\'s wage on this tripe . \\neverything about \" godzilla \" reeks almost as bad as the piles of rotting fish used to trap the beast . \\nthe script ( and let\\'s be clear here ) by devlin and emmerich is so full of plot holes and non characters as to be sure to be the recipient of next years \" razzie \" award . \\nthe dialogue between maria pitillo ( as audrey timmonds , dr . tatopoulos\\' estranged girlfriend ) and mr . broderick is so adolescent , it makes teenagers giggle in disbelief ( as happened during the screening i witnessed ) . \\nthe film could be enjoyably campy if it didn\\'t take itself so damn seriously . \\nbut to what end , as there is no commentary on humanities foibles against nature , nor is there any reference about godzilla being some sort of retaliation against mankind . \\nno . godzilla is just a big dummy that got knocked up by some french immigrants and decided to let the state of new york pay for it . \\nthe film is bleak and ugly looking . \\ntaking place at night during a rain storm , the movie has little or no depth . \\neverything is ugly and dark . \\nnew york has never looked so inhospitable since \" death wish \" . \\nin an attempt to give the film some color , audrey timmonds carries a bright red umbrella which is unique in that everyone else in the film

is nicely photographed but poorly set up . \\nyou know from the outset that nick is standing in a footprint . \\nfor a scientist , this is very poor observation . \\nlet\\'s look at some of the more interesting plot holes in the film ( this activity , is becoming almost as popular as the kevin bacon game ) : \\n1 . ) why does the french nuclear tests only affect one clutch of iguana eggs , and how do those eggs fuse into one beast ? \\n2 . ) why would a cold blooded creature choose a cold climate ( such as new york ) to nest ? \\ni don\\'t think iguana\\'s have a habit of migrating . \\n3 .

radioactive mutations surely are wondrous creatures . \\n ( note : each egg is 10 feet tall and almost as wide . \\ngodzilla would have to be over 1 , 000 feet tall to carry them all ) . \\n6 . ) godzilla can crush ships and eat helicopters , but new york cabs are made of stronger steel . \\n7 . ) godzilla can out maneuver helicopters , bullets , torpedoes and missiles , but can\\'t catch you on foot . \\n8 . ) taxis can out maneuver godzilla . \\n9 . ) godzilla can burrow through the subway system but can\\'t tear through the park avenue tunnel . \\n10 . ) why was nothing else mutated by the nuclear test as quickly as godzilla ? \\nmaybe a giant hermit crab in the sequel . \\n11 . ) galapagos iguana\\'s actually live in the french polynesian islands ? \\n12 . ) why was dr . tatopoulos brought in by the military if they were not going to listen to him anyway ? \\n13 . ) how did they evacuate new york island in less than a day , and how did they convince those new yorkers to go to new jersey ? \\n14 . ) new york television stations use vhs tape for both filming and broadcasting . \\nnew yorkers hate beta cam . \\ni could go on and on , but that would only serve to make the film seem more enjoyable than it is . \\ndon\\'t be fooled , this film has less gray matter than any episode of \" america\\'s funniest home videos \" . \\nthe performances in the film are singularly bland . \\nnot one performance belays any awe or fear in the face of this two hundred foot tall terror . \\nthe characters , in the midst of the onslaught , have time to stop and discuss the lack of good coffee , failed relationships , career choices . \\nthe only common occurrence that doesn\\'t take place here is having one of the characters have a bowel movement , but then that would have made them believable . \\ngodzilla for the most part is okay . \\nthe design of the beast is funky , if not very memorable . \\none thing that comes to mind-- the major redirection of godzilla in this film is to remove his most familiar trademark , namely his atomic breath . \\nnow , i for one can\\'t quite fathom how you can call this monster godzilla without that little trait . \\na good comparison would be to make a superman film and eliminate his ability to fly . \\nthere is so much wrong with this film that i can\\'t really recall anything recently that has left me this cold hearted ( except for my divorce ) . \\nany film that can have a two ton lizard slipping on gum balls has got to be envisioned under the influence of prozac . \\nthe addition of the baby raptors ( ah , i meant godzillas ) , are nothing but a direct rip off of \\'jurassic park \" , but with none of that film\\'s suspense or tension . \\nsuffice to say that , \" godzilla \" is without a doubt the most brain dead motion picture of the decade . \\nthis is a film that needed the hype . \\nwith the current level of writing and directing , nothing else about the film succeeds . \\nif you\\'ve seen the trailers , you\\'ve

\" , \\nbut \" can she help me get on a lifeboat ? \" \\ndicaprio is a revelation . \\ni hadn\\'t seen him before in anything , and didn\\'t know what the heck to expect , really . \\n ( honestly , i expected a bad irish accent , but cameron evidently decided that was a bad idea , so dicaprio plays a poor american artist who wins a ticket in a poker game . ) \\ndicaprio exhibits an infectious joy at being alive , and being on the titanic , that it\\'s hard not to like him . \\nfrom the moment that the ship leaves port until it hits the iceberg , dicaprio has to carry the movie and keep our interest , and he never falters . \\nwinslet\\'s character grows up a lot during the movie , and so does her performance . \\nat first , she\\'s not required to do anything but wear period clothing and look drop-dead gorgeous . \\nwe know from the narration that she\\'s monstrously unhappy with her arranged marriage to zane , but there isn\\'t any expression of these feelings until she encounters dicaprio . \\nwinslet and dicaprio develop a chemistry that manages to propel the movie along until the ship hits the iceberg . \\nit\\'s at that moment where winslet\\'s character really comes alive . \\nfaced with real danger , she drops her spoiled-rich-girl mannerisms and does a splendid job . \\nas rose and jack race around the doomed ship , looking for shelter from the freezing water and cal\\'s fiery temper , winslet turns in a superb acting performance , mixing courage and compassion and anger with sheer shrieking terror . \\nof course , the most interesting character is the ship itself . \\ncameron has clearly fallen in love with titanic , and shows her in every mood -- as a deserted wreck , down in the boiler room , up on the bridge , down in the hold , at the captain\\'s table , down in steerage -- and manages to bring the great ship back from the dead . \\ncameron\\'s greatest gift is that he allows us to fall in love with titanic as well . \\n',\n",

\\nnow for the bad news . \\nthe entire plot of \" mission to mars \" is based almost wholeheartedly on outdated and preposterous national enquirer type martian civilization tripe . \\nthe famed \\'face on mars\\' becomes the centerpiece of the film , revealing some of the most harebrained sci-fi pabulum the screen has witnessed . \\nborrowing ideas from such films as \" robinson crusoe on mars \" ( 1964 ) , quatermass and the pit ( 1967 ) , \" 2001 : a space odyssey \" , and even mario bava\\'s \" planet of the vampires \" ( \\'terrore nello spazio\\' ) ( 1965 ) , \" mission to mars \" is a hodgepodge of ideas that don\\'t add up to a satisfying whole . \\nwhile some sequences are wonderfully handled and executed , the film remains flat and un-involving . \\nso much time is giving to establishing the lead characters in the film , but to no good use . \\nthe performances are all workmen like , with only don cheadle ( as luc ) carrying any sort of real chemistry . \\ngary sinise is wasted in role that requires him to look as if he is experiencing sleep depravation . \\nand the mistaken idea of having jerry o\\'connell ( as phil ohlmyer ) play his part for comic relief is just too painful to excuse . \\nand the less said about tim robbins called in from home performance the better . \\nhe\\'s just having too much fun here to give a damn . \\nthe script has a few lapses , namely that after discovering several breaches in the hull of the ship caused by a meteorite shower , no one thinks of checking the fuel tanks or the remainder of the ship for damage . \\nthis of course leads to our heroes having to abandon their rescue ship . \\nalso , when one character sacrifices himself , the character takes on a religious demeanor that is completely at odds with the situation . \\nbut the biggest offence in the film is the horrid , intrusive score by ennio morricone . \\nsubtlety is non-existent here . \\nin fact in some scenes the music becomes so extravagant that dialogue is almost drowned out . \\nthe only sequence in which the score almost works is during the protracted meteorite shower . \\nthe pacing of the film is very leisurely . \\nafter the opening introduction of the characters ( which lasts a full 22 minutes ) , we are finally dropped onto the martian surface . \\nthen , there is another long pause in the plot for more character development , including an elaborate dance sequence in zero gravity . \\nthe film could lose about 30 minutes and actually gain some momentum . \\nthere are so many scenes of talking heads , discussing what we already know is going to happen , that it drags the film to a dead stop . \\nthe good news is that the film is absolutely sumptuous to look at . \\nthe vistas of the planet mars are majestic and awe inspiring . \\nthe design of the numerous spacecraft and suits are all expertly drafted , with a level of realism that hasn\\'t been seen since \" 2001 : a space odyssey \" . \\nthe visual effects are just stunning , from the space walk sequences , to the visualization of evolution on earth . \\nthe only fault come with the martians themselves , which look more like something out of a plastic model kit than something from another world . \\ndirector de palma stages some wonderfully creative scenes through out the film . \\nthe opening sequence alone in a seemingly un-interrupted cut lasting almost 15 minutes ( an homage\\' to hitchcock\\'s \" rope \" ) , as we are introduced to all of the characters . \\nscenes in the rescue ship , with its rotating centrifuge , are just amazing in their execution . \\nbut the nagging question , is the final explanation worth all of this sturm und drang . \\nsadly it is not . \\ndirector brian de palma has crafted an extravagant production . \\nthe set design and visual effects are all arresting . \\nbut it\\'s the comic strip denouncement that ruin what might have been a fine return to good adventurous , thought provoking science fiction . \\na disappointing film , but one that might still entertain if you can settle for the visuals . \\n',\n",

       "  b'anna and the king is at least the fourth film adaptation of margaret landon\\'s fact based novel the king and i , and it\\'s big , expensive and soulless . \\nthough good-looking , its lavish sets , fancy costumes and luscious cinematography can do little to compensate for the emotional wasteland that is peter krikes and steve meerson\\'s script . \\nso much money was spent on pretty pictures that they forgot to actually make the movie interesting . \\nthis is jodie foster\\'s first movie since the jaw-droppingly brilliant contact came out more than two years ago and it isn\\'t the best choice to show off her acting chops . \\nshe\\'s trapped in the stoic role of anna leonowens , the uptight , widowed british schoolteacher who comes to siam ( now thailand ) with her son to instruct the king\\'s ( chow yun-fat ) son in the ways of the west ( because \" the ways of england are the ways of the world ) . \\nthe king likes her so much he puts her in charge of educating the whole royal family ( 58 kids with 10 more in the way ; impressive , no ? ) . \\nthe eldest prince is none too happy about this ( \" father , have i offended you in some way ? \\nwhy do you punish me with imperialist schoolteacher ? ) , but soon gets to know anna and her stern- mother-who-loves-you personality better and comes to like her . \\nmeanwhile , siam comes under attack from the neighboring british colony of burma . \\nthe king and his close advisors suspect that this is britain\\'s doing which arouses suspicion in siam , putting anna in an uncomfortable position . \\nshe is not sure what to make of this and seems to herself suspect british involvement in the crisis but works to diffuse the king\\'s prejudices . \\nhe , though self-righteous as ever , can\\'t help but be influenced by the eloquent anna and they slowly , quietly , develop affections for each other . \\nthere is a scene in the middle of anna and the king where one of the king\\'s younger daughters dies . \\nit\\'s your classic deathbed scene , with the girl\\'s mournful eyes staring at her father , who tries only semi- successfully to maintain his composure . \\nanna then comes in and cries a bit . \\nthe sequence was there for a purpose : to evoke a strong emotional response from the viewer . \\ni\\'m usually a sucker for such scenes and yet this time , i was just sitting there , my emotions untouched . \\nthis remains true through all of the movie which remains emotionally barren . \\nwe never develop connections to the characters ; never given a reason to care . \\nthis ludicrously long epic was directed by andy tennant , whose last film was ever after , one of my favorites of 1998 . \\ni do not doubt tennant\\'s ability to put together a decent movie , but anna and the king , aside from being psychologically inept is also technologically deficient . \\nthe sets and scenery are gorgeous , but the camerawork does nothing to convey its grandeur . \\neven terrence malick managed to do more with flora and fauna in his otherwise abysmal the thin red line than tennant can muster from $75 million worth of props and a shoot in malaysia . \\nwe feel like the camera is restricted to its immediate point of view ; there are no wide tracking shots or sweeping zooms to fill us with larger-than-life awe . \\ni liked both foster and yun-fat , who give entertaining if not terribly involving performances in the two lead roles . \\nfoster\\'s generally stoic persona serves her well here , as she is playing a reserved , formal and rather underdeveloped character . \\nyun-fat is especially effective , perfectly conveying the king of siam\\'s sangfroid permeated with violent outbursts . \\nwhat does anna and the king in is its inability to involve the viewer in its characters and situations . \\nthe cast is great , the director is talented , and the budget is lavish , but this ill-advised remake of the classic rogers and hammerstein movie is unable to utilize any of those things to form a compelling whole . \\nthis is an emotionless costume epic . \\n',\n",

       "  b'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \\nbe forewarned . \\nit\\'s startling to consider that it was only a few years ago that film distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order to give the annual disney animated feature juggernaut a wide berth . \\nthe lion king had just cracked $300 million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history , continuing to build on a sturdy base left by prior flicks aladdin and beauty and the beast . \\nsince then , though , disney\\'s animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns , with pocahontas , the hunchback of notre dame , and this year\\'s hercules successively proving less and less potent . \\nwith the once seemingly-impregnable disney stranglehold on the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable , and faced with their first serious competition in the animated film market from fox\\'s anastasia , disney has brought xmas home early by dusting off the feature which sparked the modern revival of feature animation , the little mermaid . \\nwhile the animation for the film is , as is typically the case for disney films , unquestionably top-notch , the magic in the little mermaid is not its animation , but the wonderful innocence of its story and its rousingly superb music . \\nthe film\\'s storyline is fairly straightforward -- young teen falls for handsome man , father disapproves and assigns hapless chaperone to his daughter , teen disobeys father and goes to desperate lengths to win her man -- except in this case , the chaperone is a crab , the teen is a young mermaid , and the object of her desire is a human prince . \\nwhat makes the little mermaid so affecting and so emotionally resonant is the richness and charm of its characters and the sheer clarity and honest simplicity of their emotions . \\nfrom the moment mermaid ariel lays her eyes on prince eric , she\\'s resolutely smitten , and she\\'s such a pure and endearing character that one can\\'t help but invest their heart with her . \\nthis simple but touching love story , coupled with a healthy dose of smart humour , makes the little mermaid a remarkably captivating picture . \\none of the interesting things about the little mermaid is something which now curiously dates it : the voices cast for its motley crew of characters . \\nthis film was produced just before the distracting concept of using celebrity voices became in vogue , which started to a certain degree with beauty and the beast and was irrevocably exacerbated by robin williams\\' much-heralded turn in aladdin ; by the release of the lion king and henceforth , the majority of characters in the animated films were voiced by celebrities . \\nwhile it\\'s understandable that animated features lacking the name-recognition or drawing power of disney ( say , balto\\'s use of kevin bacon and bridget fonda , or even anastasia\\'s showcasing of meg ryan and john cusack ) would be forced to turn to this strategy in order to hype their products , it\\'s unfortunate that even disney has embraced this policy . \\ndo we really need to hear , say , demi moore as esmerelda in the hunchback of notre dame ? \\nis the film\\'s entertainment value really augmented by hearing a recognizable voice , rather than a voice which best suits the role ? \\n ( i\\'m not exactly on the edge of my seat for eddie murphy in the upcoming mulan . ) \\nfortunately , the performers who voice the characters in the little mermaid , although perhaps more obscure , are impeccably cast . \\nchief among them is jodi benson , a 1992 tony nominee for her stage work in crazy for you , who voices the film\\'s heroine ariel to perfection ; with a wonderfully expressive speaking voice full of youthful vigor , and gorgeous singing voice , ms . benson provides a most engaging anchor for the film . \\n ( she\\'s the only reason i\\'d even consider catching flubber . ) \\nsimilarly , samuel e . wright is terrific in the showy role of sebastian , the weary guardian crab . \\nhe easily milks his lovable character\\'s comic moments for all they\\'re worth , and his rendering of two of the little mermaid\\'s big tunes -- \" under the sea \" and \" kiss the girl \" -- have become the stuff of legend . \\npat carrol is deliciously villainous and vampy as the evil sea-witch ursula , while kenneth mars\\' booming voice conveys the stern yet affectionate authority of ariel\\'s father , king triton . \\nin large roles and small ( edie mcclurg as dotting busybody carlotta is ideal , and rene auberjonois has great fun with his exuberant french chef ) , the little mermaid is impeccably cast . \\nof course , the little mermaid will probably be best remembered for its remarkable collection of songs composed by the songwriting team of alan menken ( music ) and howard ashman ( lyrics ) , who had created little shop of horrors and would go on to compose beauty and the beast and aladdin for disney before mr . ashman\\'s untimely death . \\nnot only are mr . menken\\'s tunes unbearably catchy , but mr . ashman\\'s charming lyrics are fully integrated into the film\\'s storyline so that the songs are a virtual extension of the character\\'s dialogue , and consequently work wonderfully within the context of the film . \\nmr . menken\\'s score for the film is equally top-notch ; the sequence where eric ( voiced by christopher daniel barnes ) and ariel tour his kingdom in a horse-drawn carriage becomes magical and wondrous with mr . menken\\'s fine score . \\nit appears that most people prefer the delightfully colourful production number for the calypso-styled \" under the sea \" as joyfully crooned by mr . wright , which won the academy award and golden globe awards for best song -- indeed , one of the many little joys in screening the film during its re-release was listening to children scattered throughout the audience singing along with the tune -- but my favourite is ms . benson\\'s heartfelt rendition of the ballad \" part of your world \" , an achingly beautiful tune of yearning and hope ( wonderfully lyricized by mr . ashman ) which , accompanied by the film\\'s most dazzlingly polished animation sequence , packs an emotional wallop which literally brought tears to my eyes . \\nduring the song\\'s reprise , which builds to a crescendo with ariel arching on a rock as a wave crashes in , the cumulative effect is nothing short of breathtaking , and one becomes acutely aware that this single instance is one of the finest in animation history . \\nas of this writing , november 1997 has come to an end , as has disney\\'s limited 17-day re-release of the little mermaid . \\nthere\\'s no question that the primary motivation for , if not the film\\'s reissue itself , at least its timing , was to reinforce disney\\'s dominance in the animation market and provide direct competition to fox\\'s costly new upstart animation division and their first major venture , anastasia . \\nin every respect , the re-release of the little mermaid appears to be a success -- the film\\'s 1997 grosses have pushed its cumulative domestic gross over the magic $100 million mark ; the little mermaid proved to have remarkably strong drawing power for a film initially released only eight years ago and in many homes on video , pulling in close to $10 million in its opening weekend ; and although nobody could possibly expect the little mermaid to possibly defeat the aggressively-marketed anastasia in head-to-head competition , it siphoned enough from the fox film\\'s opening weekend totals to keep anastasia from the coveted weekend leader spot , allowing for disney\\'s odious flubber to sweep in on the subsequent week and wrestle the family demographic market share away . \\nbut although disney\\'s motives in the reissue of the little mermaid were self-serving and protectionist , the real winner is the public . \\nany reason to put this film back into theatres is a good one , and it\\'s a true joy to see this heartwarming gem back on the silver screen . \\nthe little mermaid is the best film to come out of the disney\\'s modern animation renaissance , and one of the greatest animated films ever made . \\n',\n",
       "  b'ex-universal soldier luc has to battle a group of newer-model engineered fighters gone bad . \\nthe review \\njean-claude van damme has a one-liner early on in universal soldier : the return , his latest attempt to remain relevant , that sums up this entire movie ; he says \" been there , done that . \" \\nno film critic could possibly sum up van damme\\'s recent film choices any better . \\nwhile other ageing action stars have wisely moved into other film genres ( schwarzenegger makes as many family comedies as he does action films ) , van damme stubbornly persists in sticking with what used to work for him : martial arts and guns . \\nthis unwillingness or perhaps inability to move into new genres has caused van damme to enter the straight to video world , with legionnaire never seeing the inside of a multiplex . \\nhe joins fellow martial artist/action star steven seagal as they watch their film careers rapidly fizzle away . \\nuniversal soldier : the return is truly poor . \\nthe plot is a complete copy of several action films from this decade , specifically terminator 2 : judgement day and the similarly named soldier . \\nsoldier\\'s kurt russell was an older model super-soldier sent off to retirement when circumstances forced him to battle his successors , for the good of a planet ; schwarzenegger\\'s terminator in t2 tried to save john connor from a newer model killing machine , the t-1000 ; and jean-claude , a former universal soldier , has to save the planet from the rampage of a group of , you guessed it , newer model soldiers . \\nconsidering the poor box office performance of soldier , it\\'s amazing that this project was ever given the go-ahead . \\nluc devereaux ( van damme ) was the sole remaining universal soldier ( or unisol for short ) , until he was returned to a normal , if muscular , human form . \\nin this sequel ( technically the fourth film in the series , following two straight-to-video duds that were ignored here plot-wise ) , luc is now a human trainer/consultant of sorts for the unisol program . \\nworking with dylan cotner ( xander berkeley , who interestingly also appeared in t2 ) , the unisol program has engineered a tougher , fiercer fighting force with the help of super-computer seth . \\nunfortunately , upon hearing that the program has been axed by the government , seth takes control of his soldiers , killing everyone in the building except for luc , his partner maggie , his daughter hillary and erin , a reporter trapped inside . \\nthe rest of the film involves luc trying to keep them all alive , while beating up a group of near-indestructible soldiers , most notably romeo ( popular wrestler goldberg ) . \\nthere are lots of fights , gun battles , lame plot developments and a noticeable lack of plausibility . \\nthere are so many clich ? s in this film that it is almost painful to watch . \\nluc gets saddled with the task of saving erin the reporter early on , and in the course of a single night , they go from bickering to falling for each other , to kissing . \\nerin is a pathetically-written character ; people are getting brutally gunned down all around her , and yet , not only does this not seem to frighten her , but she finds time to remind luc that she \" isn\\'t leaving without her story \" . \\nwhatever . \\nother laughable moments include a ) luc going to a strip club to get internet access ( what ? ) and b ) a group of rangers , who after having been given good advice ( luc tells them that their weapons are useless , and shows them a specific gun which should work better ) , choose to go into battle with their useless weapons anyway ( guess who wins the battle ? ) . \\nnot one single scene in universal soldier : the return has any originality to it . \\nwhen fuelled by don davis\\' loud , driving music score , the film\\'s many fights become almost passable , but mostly are full of the same ol\\' jean-claude moves . \\ndirector mic rodgers ( a former stunt co-ordinator ) keeps the action coming at a rapid pace , with only a few token serious moments to be found . \\nhis past work is evident in the many moments when characters are thrown through windows , tossed off of buildings or sent flying through the air thanks to an explosion . \\nif only jean-claude weren\\'t getting so old and slow compared to younger martial arts film actors like jet li , rodgers could probably have made a decent action film . \\nto place the blame squarely at van damme\\'s feet , however , is an injustice . \\ni\\'m not sure that anyone , not even robert deniro or edward norton , could make writers william malone and john fasano\\'s script sound good . \\none particularly painful scene is when erin asks luc how he is so sure that the aforementioned strip club will have internet access . \\nhe cringes , looks down and mutters \" uh . . . uhm . . . \\nthey all do , i saw it on 60 minutes . \\neh he he he \" the script\\'s and indeed the entire film\\'s only saving grace is goldberg . \\nhe chews up every scene he is in , obviously enjoying his role immensely . \\nhe even gives the film a few laughs , as he mutters things like \" i really don\\'t like that guy \" every time he fails to kill luc . \\nsadly , his presence is not enough to turn universal soldier : the return into anything better than a below-average action film that truly deserves to have joined its fellow sequels by going straight-to-video . \\n',\n",

\\nno , not really . \\npatricia arquette plays frankie page , a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a gift from her globe-trotting mother . \\nas it turns out , the rosary belonged to a recently-deceased brazilian priest . \\nthe priest\\'s church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan ( gabriel byrne ) because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue . \\nfather kiernan is an investigator who has made a career out of disproving supposed religious signs , but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue . \\nhis investigation is soon called off , however , when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata , in which a person is inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ . \\nfather kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie\\' s story , considering she\\'s an atheist , but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself , he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on . \\nhe eventually begins to suspect that his boss , cardinal houseman ( jonathan pryce ) , is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church . \\nas it turns out , the dead priest had been working on the translation of a \" fifth gospel \" before they were excommunicated . \\nthe new rupert wainwright music video . \\n . \\n . \\ni mean film \" stigmata \" is the sort of film that starts off ok and only gets worse . \\nindeed , it would have been good if it were a music video , because it\\'s only interesting for about five minutes . \\ni\\'m not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slow-motion , double-exposure , and extreme close-ups ( whoaaaaaa ! ! ! ! ) , other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and , yes , he has been to film school . \\nhis camera trickery is interesting for a little while , but eventually , it becomes headache-inducing . \\nwhat this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue ( such as it is ) , with wainwright screaming at the audience , \" see ? \\nlook at what i can do ! \\ni\\'m an ex-cellent dir-ect-or . \" \\nmaybe then he\\'d explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slow-motion shots of water dripping in reverse , or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying ( ooh , scary ! ) . \\nif there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery , i didn\\'t see it . \\njust when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story , here comes a double-exposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever . \\narrrrrrrghhhh . \\n . \\n . \\nthen again , the superfluous camera trickery wouldn\\'t bother me if \" stigmata \" had a story or characters that were remotely engaging . \\nthough wainwright\\'s vanity certainly doesn\\'t help , he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script . \\nwhere are plot continuity and character development when you need them ? \\ncase in point : frankie page is the character that ( i assume ) we are supposed to identify and sympathize with , but we aren\\'t given any back story on her character , or any reason to like her . \\nthe extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hard-working hairdresser ( who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building ) and she\\'s kind of cute , so let\\'s start the bleeding ! \\nthe fact that she\\'s clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn\\'t help , either . \\naccording to frankie page , what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back ? \\ngo clubbing ! \\nsure , that makes sense . \\narquette , byrne , and pryce give it the old college try , but their characters are so one-dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking . \\nscenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat , because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable . \\neven though frankie page\\'s life is falling apart before her very eyes , she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon . \\neven more curiously , he seems to be interested in her advances . \\nfather andrew\\'s religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic . \\nas for pryce , he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle , \" i\\'ll get you , my pretty , \" for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded . \\ntrust me , i\\'m not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be a villain . \\nwhat\\'s worse , after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats , we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction , veers off in another , then another , and ends up being totally incomprehensible . \\nfirst of all , the film doesn\\'t even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details . how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary ? \\nhow come an atheist like her was chosen , since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata ? \\nactually , i\\'m not sure what frankie was posessed by . \\nsupposedly , stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit , but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest , and later by some evil spirit ( i think ) . \\nwhich one is it ? \\nthe answer to this question , of course , is very simple : the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr . wainwright wants to use this time . \\nfurthermore , the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrap-up , and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church . \\nif you do any research at all about the gospel of st . thomas , you\\'ll find that it is not being suppressed by the church ( as the film seems to claim ) , but that it is readily available at your local library . \\nthere\\'s nothing the catholics need to worry about , though . \\n \" stigmata\\'s \" religion is so off-base that it can\\'t be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church . \\nif they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters , they should have gone all-out and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns , which would have been far more interesting . \\ni\\'m not catholic ; in fact , i don \\'t care much for the catholic church , but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any means . \\nit\\'s rare to see a film that fails on as many levels as \" stigmata \" does . \\nit\\' s not thought-provoking , though it would like to be , and it is definitely not scary , though it pretends to be . \\ni\\'m not sure why they tried to pass this off as a horror film , because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story . \\nmaybe it\\'s an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever . \\nthe initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over , and over , and over . \\nlike so many films of the mtv generation , this one suffers from overkill . \\nso much is overdone in \" stigmata , \" that it eventually has no effect on the audience , leaving us to pick out the film\\'s ( many ) flaws . \\ni\\'m also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st . thomas is so earth-shattering . \\nwhen we finally hear it , the saying sounds like something every five-year-old learns on their first day of sunday school , which means that for all its flash , the whole film is really much ado about nothing . \\nthe dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog , and \" stigmata \" is it . \\n',\n",
       "  b'the obvious reason for producing a sequel to an immensely popular movie is to acquire continued profits . \\nthe rationale is sound , but in many cases of this and recent years , the sequel is a shoddy product that\\'s exposed for the cash-milking vehicle it really is . \\nlast year\\'s speed 2 and scream 2 , as well as this year\\'s species ii have all been products that have been decisively less than satisfactory . \\nin some cases , a sequel can even discredit its predecessor , as with the latest neo-slasher flick , i still know what you did last summer . \\nwhatever uniqueness the original might\\'ve had now seems trite and overplayed when paired with this abominable thriller . \\njulie james ( jennifer love hewitt ) and ray bronson ( freddie prinze jr . ) are back from the original to star in i still know , reprising their roles in typical fashion . \\njulie and ray experience a rather predictable falling-out at the beginning of the movie , leaving the door wide open for newcomer will benson ( matthew settle ) . \\nwill and julie hit it off , and along with friends karla ( brandy norwood ) and tyrell ( mekhi phifer ) , the foursome heads off to a radio station-giveaway vacation in the tropics . \\nunfortunately , things aren\\'t so peachy once they arrive , and with a regularity you could set your watch by , the infamous fisherman ( muse watson ) is back with his hook . \\nit\\'s another bloody showdown , complete with cliffhanger ending . \\nthere\\'s not much that\\'s original about i still know , and with the market saturated by gen-x thrillers like this one , it\\'s unlikely that i still know will get any recognition other than that of a bad sequel . \\nfor die-hard fans of the genre , this will be required viewing material , but the bottom line is that the material here is just recycled from the original i know what you did last summer . \\nthe aura of thrillerism surrounding the plot isn\\'t heightened by skillful scripting or camera work , but rather a tense , string-based score and manipulative editing . \\nthe man with the hook ends up becoming very belittled this time around when the script gives him too many lines of dialogue -- he goes from being a scary figure to a nutcase in a few short and painful moments . \\nmuch of the mystery is dropped for the sake of getting the point . \\nthe whole reason the plot exists - julie and karla must guess the capital of brazil in order to win the trip from the radio station - is a dead giveaway , lessening suspense and creating a hurry-up-and-wait timing problem . \\nand , whereas the killer\\'s identity might\\'ve been a question in the first movie , it\\'s almost a given here , which changes the dynamic of the movie drastically . \\nthree or four teens run automatically from a man in a rain slicker they nonchalantly refer to as \" the killer . \" \\nthey\\'re almost used to it , and the performances show it - not hewitt , nor prinze , nor brandy , nor phifer give a decent show . \\nand so , in the end , it\\'s left wide open for a third movie and - most likely - a brand new supporting cast . \\ngod help us . \\n',\n",

       "  b'as we see the terrible events that unfold before our eyes in the middle east at the moment , hollywood doesn\\'t loose the oppertunity to get involved , by telling stories and expressing opinions . \\nthis film centers on a relationship forged throughout the adult lifetimes of two marine colonels , hays hodges ( tommy lee jones ) and terry childers ( samuel l . jackson ) . \\nthey fought side by side in vietnam , where childers saved hodges\\' life by shooting an unarmed pow . \\nthat\\'s against the rules of war but understandable , in this story anyway , under the specific circumstances . \\ncertainly hodges is not complaining . \\nyears pass . \\nhodges , whose wounds make him unfit for action , gets a law degree and becomes a marine lawyer . \\nchilders , is now a respected and much-decorated hero that has served his country with his life and sould . \\nbecause of his excellent record , childers is sent to yemen to rescue the american ambassador ( ben kingsley ) , cowering in the embassy under assault from violent demonstrators and snipers blasting from rooftops . \\nchilders does what he has to do : evacuate the family and protect the men under his command . \\nafter three marines die and the colonel thinks he sees ground fire , he orders his troops to shoot into the firing crowd . \\nmore than 80 yemeni men , women , and children are mowed down . \\nchilders is immediately accused of ordering his men to fire on a crowd and murder of unarmed civilians . \\nhe persuades his old friend hodges to represent him in the courtroom drama that occupies the second half of the film . \\ndid childers violate authorized u . s . military rules of engagement ?

\\nwhere is the u . n . ? \\nthe film ends without even telling the most interesting story : what happens on the international arena ? \\nthis film ( in a way akin to films such as \" a few good men \" ) has already been accused of breaking the rules of morality and ethics and even of racism . \\nthese accusations are pretty heavy , but also unfair . \\nwhat director william friedklin truly broke was the rules of decent filmmaking . \\none of the earliest apparent problems with \\'rules of engagement\\' is its lack of credibility . \\nthe entire operation in yemen may remind us about what happens in the middle east right now , but is overdone , contrived and unrealistic - as if a chain of events had to happen in a particular manner in order for the plot to proceed . \\na lot of it is so cheesy that no one could possibly accept it as reality . \\nthat is precisely why it\\'s not offensive . \\nit is completely unobjective . \\nmany stories are started and never finished . \\nmany questions are asked , but never answered . \\na lot of parallels are referring to nothing . \\nit seems that neither the director , producers or the screenwriter can make up their minds about the contents of their film . \\nis it about arab mentality ?

       "  b'georges polti once wrote a paper called \" the thirty-six dramatic situations , \" in which he asserted the fact that all drama could be defined by no more than thirty-six different situations . \\nthis may be the modern restatement of the biblical prophecy from ecclesiastes , \" there\\'s nothing new under the sun . \" \\nthe faculty , the latest movie by from dusk till dawn director robert rodriguez , certainly proves this in typical hollywood fashion . \\nthere\\'s not a measureable fraction of original material in this unworthy outing . \\ndrawing elements from both the puppet masters and invasion of the body snatchers , screenwriter kevin williamson ( of scream 2 credit ) gives us a horror tale set in middle america ( ohio ) one eventful fall . \\nmaking use of a cast of unusually stock characters , williamson designs an alien invasion that will not be done independence day-style but rather \" through the back door . \" \\nparasitic aliens take over the faculty of a run-down high school and soon have infested most of the student body , leaving it up to the ensemble of principal characters to win the day . \\nthe lack of gusto is the movie\\'s major stumbling block . \\neven though the genre has seen movies that have a lack for quality such as this , they\\'ve been saved by an energetic approach . \\nthis casts more than a shadow of a doubt on williamson\\'s ability , who enjoyed success with the wes craven-directed scream but couldn\\'t pull anything solid in for this outing or i know what you did last summer . \\nalthough he designs the faculty with more of a sci-fi bent than his typical slasher picture , it still comes down to the same results : throw the stock characters in a steel cage match and see who comes out alive . \\non that level , the main roles are played by virtual unknowns . \\nonly the recognizeable elijah wood ( deep impact ) is at the front ; other than that , the screen veterans are saved for the minor roles of the alien teachers . \\nperhaps williamson has it in mind to champion these up-and-comers to the fame that their scream and last summer counterparts achieved ; but to do that , they\\'d all need to star in their own wb television show about the horrors of puberty a la \" dawson\\'s creek . \" \\nneedless to say the acting is far from top notch , nor does necessity ask that it should be . \\nthere is a moment or two of genuine horror , but unfortunately williamson and rodriguez did not take the story far enough in the sci-fi direction to make any use of it . \\nin sum , the faculty was just one long shot that did not pay off . \\n',\n",
       "  b'call it touched by a demon . \\ngregory hoblit\\'s fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual , horrific twist . \\nif marketed properly , this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim , dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven . \\nin fact , there\\'s even a little twin peaks to be found here , albeit with the lion\\'s share of the weirdness distilled out . \\n ( remember bob ? ) \\nthe biggest failing of fallen is that , although it\\'s consistently interesting , it\\'s not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope . \\na serial killer ( elias koteas ) has been on the loose in philadephia , but detective john hobbes ( denzel washington ) , the noblest man on the police force , has brought him to justice . \\nnow , during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber , the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes , \" what goes around really goes around . \" \\nshortly thereafter , he begins to sing \" time is on my side \" as he\\'s taken on his last walk . \\nminutes later , the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead . \\nbut for hobbes , the nightmare is just beginning , because reese wasn\\'t a normal psychopath ? he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel . \\nand , with reese\\'s death , azazel is free to hop from body to body , murdering and wreaking havoc at will . \\nonly hobbes and a pretty , female theology teacher ( embeth davidtz ) have an inkling of what they\\'re up against . \\nthe rest of the cops , including hobbes\\' partner , jonesy ( john goodman ) ; lou ( james gandolfini ) , a newcomer to the department ; and lieutenant stanton ( donald sutherland ) , don\\'t have a clue , and , as a result , they are in mortal danger . \\nas depicted by hoblit ( primal fear ) and cinematographer newton thomas sigel , philadelphia is a dark , dreary place ? a gothic city rather than a modern one . \\nno skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown . \\nthe most famous landmark to appear isn\\'t the liberty bell or independence hall ; it\\'s geno\\'s steaks . \\nshadows and night scenes abound . \\nthe days are cloudy and unpromising . \\nthis is the kind of setting where it\\'s easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men . \\nfallen\\'s plot is brimming with potential , not all of which is realized . \\nsomehow , i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise . \\nbut the level of terror , like that of gore , is kept in check . \\nnevertheless , there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks . \\nthe film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual . \\nof the several dozen actors to play azazel , the best is by far elias koteas ( exotica , crash ) , who , despite only being on screen for about ten minutes , gives a fantastically charged performance . \\njohn goodman also seems to be enjoying himself , although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick . \\nsadly , however , these two are the only ones who excel . \\neveryone else , including denzel washington , is boring . \\nwashington\\'s flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film . \\nit\\'s not that he\\'s bad per se , but he\\'s not very interesting . \\nthere\\'s no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character , and that keeps us distanced , however slightly , from hobbes . \\nas circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop , and as his life-or-death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate , i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was . \\nwashington\\'s subdued approach is part of the reason for this ; i never felt a sense of urgency . \\nhowever , at least washington was believable , which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz ( schindler\\'s list ) and donald sutherland . \\nto be fair , the flaws in their characters aren\\'t all acting-related ; neither stanton nor gretta milano are well-written . \\nthat said , however , there\\'s nothing inspired about either davidtz\\'s or sutherland\\'s work . \\nboth appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts , as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi-dimensional individual . \\nnarratively , fallen has a few glaring weaknesses . \\nalthough the plot proceeds with a convoluted , game-like structure , it uses a denzel washington-supplied voiceover to overexplain matters . \\nat times , this is actually helpful , and it has a use beyond the obvious , but there are occasions when ponderous lines like \" i like the night ?

with the imagery . \\nthe first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn\\'t been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years . \\nthe island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn\\'t want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money . \\nbrody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute . \\nhooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( \" it\\'s a perfect engine , an eating machine \" ) make it that much more terrifying . \\nwhen vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark . \\nthe entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it . \\n \" jaws \" is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror . \\nit is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it\\'s no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by \" star wars \" ) . \\neven today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock\\'s \" psycho , \" and it never seems to age . \\nalthough grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill . \\nthe technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects . \\nscheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time \" jaws \" was made , but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman . \\nnevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark . \\nscheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what\\'s right and going against the entire town . \\n \" it\\'s your first summer here , you know , \" mayor vaughn warns him . \\ndreyfuss , who had previously been seen in \" american graffiti \" ( 1973 ) and \" the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz \" ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers . \\nhowever , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie\\'s captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards . \\nbordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism . \\nhe\\'s slightly deranged , and shaw\\'s performance is almost a caricature . \\nhowever , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars . \\nquint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u . s . s . \\nindianapolis , a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese . \\nhis tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair-raising than anything spielberg put on screen . \\nshaw delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film . \\nof course , we can\\'t leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind\\'s fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature . \\na shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs , great whites do exist , they can be as large as the shark in \" jaws , \" and they are a threat . \\nevery one of spielberg\\'s subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into . \\nthe shark in \" jaws \" was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed \" bruce \" by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles . \\nmany have forgotten , but \" jaws \" was a sort of precursor to \" waterworld \" ( 1995 ) , a movie\\'s who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb . \\nbut , as we can see now , spielberg overcame all the obstacles , and delivered one of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to come out of hollywood . \\n',\n",

       "  b'billed as a \" feminist sex fantasy \" , this spirited , imaginative and thoroughly engaging film by the award-winning canadian director cynthia roberts , is destined for extreme reactions . \\ncamille paglia enthusiasts will no doubt champion this heart-felt tale of the title character bubbles galore ( nina hartley ) , a porn-actress-turned-porn-producer who faces an uphill battle in her quest for sexual and economic independence . \\nhowever , those in the andrea dworkin camp , will no doubt loathe the film\\'s decidedly pro-porn stance . \\npolitical considerations aside , however , this is a delightful lesbian love story as the film takes us on a whirlwind tour of bubbles\\' romantic entanglements with a naive and virginal young porn starlet dory drawers ( shauny sexton ) . \\nin the backdrop , however is bubbles\\' loyal assistant vivian klitorsky ( tracy wright ) who pines longingly for the affections of her bubbly boss . \\nthis femme-butch-femme triangle is what provides the film with considerable humanity * and * sensuality . \\nin addition to the romantic aspects of the story , bubbles is being stalked and terrorized by her ex-boyfriend godfrey montana ( daniel macivor ) , a slimy porn mogul who wishes to make her life as miserable as he can possibly make it . \\nwhen his plans to sabotage her latest film fall through , he snaps and psychotically decides to kill her . \\nthese proceedings are presided over by a most heavenly presence . \\ngod herself - yes , in the world of this film , god , is most definitely a \" her \" - and a chorus of undulating , scantily-clad angels , have their most watchful and lustful eyes on the events as they unfold , adding a lovely fantasy element to this frothy concoction . \\nthis bright , colourful and deliriously sexy film is chock-full of great performances . \\nmaking her dramatic debut , after appearing in over 300 triple x adult films , porn star nina hartley takes command of her role with considerable assurance and a screen presence which puts many other contemporary \\'straight\\' actresses to shame . \\nhartley has overwhelming star power , and one wonders why other non-triple-x producers haven\\'t used her bountiful talents . \\nit is also interesting to note that hartley appears in the recent release of \" boogie nights \" , a film which takes a far more traditional doom-and-gloom approach to the porn industry . \\nmaking a cameo appearance in the role of god , former porn actress annie sprinkle , a true artist in her own right - gives the entire film an earthy , sensual glow and certainly solidifies and , by her very appearance , downright justifies the themes of the movie . \\nthe other performances are equally solid . \\ndaniel macivor appropriately chews up the scenery as the villainous godfrey and tracy wright lends able support with her complex role . \\nshauny sexton , an erotic dancer and pin-up model , makes an impressive screen debut . \\noverall , bubbles galore is a film which wears its politics on its sleeve and very proudly indeed . \\nat one point , the title character declares that \" instead of trying to save women from the sex trade , we should be working to ensure that the sex trade is a safe place for women to work \" . \\nthe direction by cynthia roberts is daring and subversive . \\nroberts is not afraid to plunge the otherwise straight-ahead and simple narrative into extended and extremely avant-garde montage sequences . \\nthe love scenes between the women are especially beautiful . \\nthe musical score by nicholas stirling blends cool jazz and lounge stylings , while the skilful cinematography by harald bachmann terrifically captures a blend of garish 70\\'s porn and psychedelia . \\namazingly , this film appears to have received a good deal of its funding from a variety of canadian government cultural agencies . \\nthis speaks volumes towards the importance of state funding for culture , as one cannot imagine such an entertaining , original and vital film being made in a traditional setting where conformity and formula rule the day . \\nbubbles galore seems to be making the film festival rounds and does not , at present , appear to have any traditional distribution in place , so keep your eye on the alternative film listings for this one . \\nit\\'s funny , sexy and subversive . \\nand it shouldn\\'t be missed . \\n',\n",
       "  b'it has been three long years since quentin tarantino stunned the cinema world by claiming the cannes film festival\\'s palme d\\'or , a $100 million-plus box office gross , and an oscar nomination ? all for his sophomore outing , pulp fiction . \\nsince then , the talented film maker has been virtually invisible , surfacing briefly as a co-director of the wildly uneven four rooms and the screenwriter of the gory vampire-fest , from dusk till dawn . \\nin between , he has moonlighted as an \" actor \" with several decidedly unmemorable performances . \\nnow , with much fanfare and anticipation , tarantino has returned with his third directorial effort , jackie brown . \\nand , while this motion picture , adapted from elmore leonard\\'s novel , rum punch , offers solid entertainment , those expecting another bravura outing from tarantino will leave theaters disappointed . \\nfor the most part , jackie brown is a pretty ordinary crime movie . \\nthe story , which starts out slowly , develops into a twisty affair , with double-crosses and triple-crosses . \\nand the movie is littered with occasional tarantino trademarks : witty dialogue , unexpected gunfire , \\'70s pop tunes , and close-ups of womens\\' bare feet . \\nyet , for all of that , the production is something of a letdown . \\nthe sheer , in-your-face exuberance that marked reservoir dogs and especially pulp fiction is absent . \\nthe mostly-straightforward chronology of jackie brown doesn\\'t match up favorably to the non-linear style of tarantino\\'s previous efforts ? an approach that added tension and edginess to the narratives . \\nand there aren\\'t nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around . \\nthere\\'s a samuel l . jackson monologue about guns , a jackson/chris tucker argument regarding the merits of hiding in a car trunk , and a jackson/robert de niro exchange that recalls some of the jackson/travolta material from pulp fiction , but that\\'s about it . \\njackie brown\\'s lone \" innovation \" is its presentation of a crucial sequence from three different perspectives . \\nthis isn\\'t exactly an original technique ? it has been done numerous times before , most famously in akira kurosawa\\'s rashomon and most recently in edward zwick\\'s courage under fire . \\nhowever , while in those two movies ( and others ) , there was a legitimate plot reason for the multiple points-of- view , tarantino\\'s sole purpose for using it appears to be because it\\'s unconventional . \\nhad the scenes in question been shown from only one of the three vantages , nothing would have been lost . \\nas a result , this aspect of the film is little more than a curiosity . \\nfor the second picture in a row , tarantino is attempting to revive the career of a \\'70s icon . \\nthis time around , instead of john travolta , it\\'s blaxploitation queen pam grier ( foxy brown has become jackie brown ) . \\nin one of many nods to the most famous segment of grier\\'s career , tarantino uses a \\'70s song to accompany her first appearance during the opening credits . \\nthere are also several instances during jackie brown when the director offers a sly wink towards certain conventions of the blaxploitation genre ( although grier never does any butt-kicking ) . \\ngrier is jackie brown , a flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs and money into the united states . \\nshe\\'s working for gun dealer ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) , but she keeps her mouth shut under questioning , despite pressure from ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , a federal official . \\nno longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie , ordell arranges for a bail bondsman , max cherry ( robert forster , tv\\'s \" banyon \" ) to post the necessary $10 , 000 , then plans to shoot jackie if she proves disloyal . \\njackie passes ordell\\'s test , however , and soon the two of them are plotting a way to smuggle $500 , 000 of ordell\\'s money into the united states without tipping off the feds . \\nsoon , just about everyone is after that money , including jackie , max , ray , ordell\\'s perpetually oversexed and drugged-out girlfriend , melanie ( bridget fonda ) , and his right-hand man , louis ( robert de niro ) . \\nunsurprisingly , the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel l . jackson , but ordell isn\\'t nearly as invigorating or compelling a character as jules from pulp fiction . \\nin addition to looking fantastic , pam grier is also quite good , although hers is not an oscar- caliber performance ( although she might get a nomination ) . \\nrobert forster and michael keaton are solid in their tough-guys-who-rarely- smile roles . \\nbridget fonda is around for three discernible reasons : to look sexy in a bikini , to provide a little twisted comedy , and to satisfy tarantino\\'s foot fetish . \\nrobert de niro is criminally underused in a part that could have been played equally well by any grungy- looking , middle-aged actor . \\nthe film , which clocks in at several minutes over the two-and-a- half hour mark , is probably too long for the material , but the plot is convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughout ( although the payoff is a letdown ) . \\ntarantino keeps things moving along nicely , with a heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction , but , on the whole , this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from the director himself . \\nwhen it comes to recent caper films ( like the grifters and bound ) , jackie brown is a second-tier effort . \\nit\\'s an entertaining diversion , but not a masterpiece , and certainly not an oscar contender . \\n',\n",

. \\nwhen you add this to some of the wild effects in the computer generated world , it all adds up to an eyeful . \\nas i already said , the visuals far outpace the rest of the film . \\nacting in the matrix is not bad , but it certainly isn't real good either . \\nkeanu reeves gives his usual fairly emotionless performances . \\nalthough to his credit , it is one of his better performances . \\nlaurence fishburne on the other hand often seemed to forget that he was in a sci-fi action film . \\nmore than a few times he delivered his lines as if he thought he was performing in some sort of shakespearean drama . \\njoe pantoliano was a little under used in this film but he made the most with what he had . \\ncarrie-anne moss turned out a surprisingly good performance for this her first feature film role . \\nit's nice to see that she was cast as much for her talent as for her breathtaking looks . \\nyou have to give all of the main actors a healthy dose of credit for the work that they obviously put into the physical training for their roles in this film . \\nit was clear that no small effort went into getting the moves down perfectly for the fighting sequences . \\ni also put much of the blame for the somewhat strained performances in the matrix on the dialogue , which was terrible at times . \\nin more than a few places it got way too existential for my liking and at other times it was just plain weird . \\nit almost seems as though the writers were having a difficult time trying to figure out how to explain the concept for the movie . \\nso they decided to make the dialogue as obtuse as possible so that no one could figure out what the heck they were talking about . \\nthereby covering up any leaps of faith that they may have had to make in the departments of logic and believability . \\nmy other major complaint with the matrix was with the very unsatisfying ending . \\nthe setup for it was hokey and frankly used in many a bad film before . \\nthe ending itself was just plain strange . \\nthe main reasons to recommend the matrix are the visual effects and computer animation which make this a real treat to watch . \\nwhile the rest of the film ( acting , dialogue and to a degree plot ) detract from the high production values , they don't detract enough to prevent me from recommending the matrix as a fun way to spend an evening . \\n\",\n",

\\neven whit stillman\\'s _the_last_days_of_disco_ , which wasn\\'t so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a group of hip-to-only-themselves club-hopping preppies , featured at least one extended dance scene . \\ndancing isn\\'t the only thing glazed over in _54_--so is the sex , but that may not be entirely christopher\\'s fault . \\nfrom what i\\'ve heard , his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring , starting with the shane character : he was conceived ( and actually filmed ) as a wild , morally ambiguous bisexual , which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54\\'s legend . \\nbut somewhere between principal photography and the final cut , shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out ; consequently , so was the film . \\naside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film , shane\\'s fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie ( sela ward ) , and an abbreviated bedhopping montage , the sexual dimension is just about ignored . \\nshane , in this incarnation , is sanitized to the point of blandness , an idealistic do-gooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club , julie black ( campbell ) , a worldly soap star with , yes , a heart of gold . \\nthis tacked-on \" romance \" would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience . \\nthey fail on both counts . \\nultimately , _54_\\'s failure comes down to three letters : f-u-n . \\nas in , there isn\\'t any to be had for the audience . \\ntoo much time is spent with the boring shane , and too little is spent on the club floor , where all the action took place . \\nanyhow , though , whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively . \\nwhen anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club , it should be a euphoric height , for her , the crowd , and the audience ; however , the moment doesn\\'t get a chance to reach that level , for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality , which also mars the film\\'s conclusion ( one of the last-minute reshoots ) . \\nstrangely upbeat and wistful , the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying . \\nthere is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out there--two of them , in fact--but _54_ is not one of them . \\nthey\\'re on cable tv : a couple of documentaries produced by e ! and vh1 . \\nthese two fascinating looks at the club and all the sordid goings-on within it show that there\\'s still a great disco movie to be made . \\nthe problem is , after the critical and certain box office failure of _54_ , the subject may have run its hollywood course . \\n',\n",
       "  b'eight years after its release , disney has decided to re-release the little mermaid theatrically for 17 days ( and 17 long nights ) only . \\ncoincidentally , it was reintroduced to theaters the same day fox\\'s animated film anastasia was released . \\nyou know disney , they can\\'t deal with the threat of any other studio getting even a small piece of the crust of the kiddie entertainment pie , so when someone else wants to make a little money , they counter with an old \" masterpiece \" from their vault and , you know what , i went to see this 1989 cartoon rather than the brand new one from fox . \\nlet no one say disney is losing its monopoly on the market . \\nthey still have hotels on boardwalk _and_ park place . \\nbelieve it or not , today , november 25 , 1997 , at 5 : 05 p . m . , i saw the little mermaid for the first time . \\nit took me a few years to get over an aversion to this movie that was caused seven years ago , when i stayed with one of my mom\\'s friends for a couple weeks . \\nthey had a young child who listened to the little mermaid soundtrack constantly and , over that two week period , i heard every song from the movie probably a hundred times . \\nby the time i got back home , i promised myself i\\'d never see the movie . \\nbut promises are made to be broken , especially when you\\'re looking at a 17-day , limited engagement . \\ndamn those shrewd disney marketers and their mind games . \\nthe little mermaid is based on a hans christian anderson fairy tale , but it\\'s disney-ized , which means lots of talking animals and bursting into song . \\nit also means the heroine is a total babe who shows off cleavage from a seashell bra at all times . \\ni never wanted so much to be a pair of shells . . . \\nthe heroine , of course , is ariel ( voice of jodi benson ) , a 16-year-old mermaid who is going through that rebellious phase . \\nshe skips her concert to explore a wrecked ship and hang out with a seagull that talks like buddy hackett , who tries to orient her to the mysterious world of humans . \\nshe\\'s also dealing with feelings she hasn\\'t had before -- which comes when you get scales in places you didn\\'t use to have them -- about a handsome prince ( no disney movie would be complete without one ) . \\nher father , king triton of the merpeople , strictly forbids such lusting after the ways of the \" savage \" humans , in a condemnation that reads as a not-so-subtle analogy about old- fashioned parents who forbid interracial dating . \\nwhat\\'s a king to do , though ? \\nthe girl\\'s in love and even total destruction of her little shrine to the human world doesn\\'t deter her . \\nariel saves the prince\\'s life when a hurricane rises up , and just has to meet him . \\nshe makes a deal with ursula , the sea witch ( voice of pat carroll ) . \\nyou know she\\'s evil because she has a huge potbelly and one of the worst asses in cartoon history . \\nshe also has octopus tentacles for feet ( something those dr . scholl\\'s corn pads will not fix ) and offers to help ariel out . \\nshe\\'ll make her a human for three days if ariel will give up her pretty voice ; ariel has three days to make that prince kiss her , or else she becomes a slave to the witch forever . \\nand if she pricks her finger on a sewing machine or eats an evil apple , she\\'ll fall asleep forever . \\nit\\'s a simplistic plot , yes , but the little mermaid was a revolution in the disney world , coming after such lackluster efforts as the black cauldron and oliver and company . \\nit ranks as one of the best disney cartoons , certainly since the \\'50s . \\nall the elements are there -- memorable songs like \" under the sea \" and \" kiss the girl , \" cartoon animals like sebastian and flounder , an evil villain who still has characterization and charm , and a fair amount of humor that caters to adults as well as children . \\nthe little mermaid is worth a big-screen ticket in 1997 , so hurry up , you only have five days left . \\nserving america for more than 1/25th of a century ! \\n',\n",

\\nwell , yes it does . \\nand it may make you think twice before you consider dating anyone your office . \\nfor the uninitiated , newcomers aaron eckhart and matt malloy play chad and howard , two corporate drones who are dispatched by their nameless company to a remote branch office for a six week assignment . \\nchad and howard are archetypes , examples of which you can no doubt find in your own place of business . \\nchad is the blond golden boy , genetically engineered for success , the natural charmer who seems to glide effortlessly up the corporate ladder . \\nhoward is chad\\'s boss , but he is weaker of will , the clumsy practitioner of office politics who has achieved his position through dogged persistence rather than raw talent . \\nwe first meet them awaiting their flight in a drab airport lounge . \\nthere chad suggests a scheme worthy of a shakespearean villain : he and howard will find a vulnerable single woman at the branch office , woo her simultaneously , win her love , and then dump her . \\nthe reason ? \\nboth men have recently been dumped themselves , and chad sees an easy route to revenge against the fairer sex . \\n \" it\\'ll restore a little dignity to our lives , \" he says . \\nhoward , helpless against the force of chad\\'s will , agrees to the plan . \\nthey quickly spot their prey in the form of christine ( stacy edwards ) , a fragile deaf woman working as a temp . \\nchad moves in for the kill , flashing his golden boy smile , plying christine with lunch , then flowers , then dinner . \\nhoward follows suit , though his efforts are in contrast ham-handed and desperate . \\nflattered to have the attention of two eligible men , christine dates them both . \\nyou can guess which one she falls for . \\nsoon a tragic lovers\\' triangle develops : christine loves chad , chad loves himself , and howard loves christine on the grounds that , since she\\'s handicapped and shy , she just might be wretched and lonely enough to settle for him . \\nadult social interaction never really progresses beyond the level of junior high , does it ? \\nin chad , writer/director labute and actor eckhart have created one of the most chilling monsters ever committed to film-hannibal lector may eat human flesh , but chad is an eater of souls . \\nhis evil is as subtle as a viper\\'s , and as easy as his smile . \\nwe watch in stunned disbelief as he back-stabs coworkers , humiliates his subordinates , and works his deadly venom into christine\\'s heart . \\nhis character would be a joke if he wasn\\'t so chillingly real- all of us have worked with a chad , and some of us may be him . \\nhe\\'s the guy who takes your job and then laughs at you for your weakness . \\nif one of his co-workers should happen to go postal and walk into the office with a bag full of handguns , he had best have his escape route clearly in mind . \\npolitics is his game , and the modern cubicle-filled office is his playground . \\nmen wears the guise of a black comedy , but it functions best as allegory . \\nthe most controversial moment in the film happens when chad humiliates a black temp by asking him how badly he wants to succeed in the company , then forces him to prove it in a manner i won\\'t describe . \\nthe scene is charged with racism and fraught with peril . \\ncould it happen in the real world ? \\nprobably not . \\ntaken as allegory , however , it is representative of the treatment of the meek by the powerful in all facets of society . \\nmaybe it\\'s just the english major in me , but chad , in his motiveless cruelty towards christine and his careful manipulation of howard , can be seen as a symbol of unbridled capitalism , of greed without conscience . \\nthe entire film is a metaphor for social darwinism- only the strong will survive . \\nthe marvel of labute\\'s multi-layered script is that it can disturb each member of its audience in an entirely different way . \\nbut does the film work as entertainment ? \\nits darned funny in spots , particularly in the men\\'s room scenes , which demonstrate the lengths to which guys will go to hold a conversation while engaged in the most basic of bodily functions . \\nit works less well as drama , since by necessity the characters in an allegory tend to be flat ciphers . \\nstacy edwards gives a measured dignity to christine , and succeeds in making us care for her , but by the end of the film we still know nothing about her . \\nlikewise , chad and howard are simply the sum of their actions . \\nby the end of the film you\\'ll feel as if you\\'ve met a genuine monster in chad ; perhaps we can also classify men as a horror film . \\ncertainly those expecting a conventional hollywood resolution to the story will walk away disappointed . \\nbut the picture is often mesmerizing , and the script is a work of fine craftsmanship , which makes it well worth your time . \\nlike all good films , it offers a myriad of parallels to the outside world . \\nwhile watching chad in his moment of triumph , i couldn\\'t help but think that bill gates must have felt the same sort of cold , merciless satisfaction when he finally stuck it to steve jobs . \\nthere may be a little bit of chad in all of us , but some of us have taken chad-ness to the level of art . \\n',\n",

' \\n-sound advice from capone ( paul campbell ) to his squaddie ( or partner ) , floyd ( winston bell ) . \\njamaican film , shot entirely on video , featuring a standard cop movie plot mixed with a dash of john woo-styled brotherhood morals ( and a little gunplay ) . \\ncapone , a tough as nails super cop , gets a transfer back to his hometown of kingston after successfully taking down some gangsters that have broken into his home ( while he was with his lady ) and killed his partner in front of him . \\nwhen he arrives , he discovers that the ghetto where he grew up has gotten worse , thanks mainly to the crime boss wonie ( jamaican film veteran carl bradshaw ) , so named because his left hand has been amputated and replaced by a grasping hook ) . \\ncapone discovers that wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for the area churches and , much to his disappointment , also finds out his childhood friend ratty ( mark danvers ) has been helping him . \\ntorn between doing his job and protecting his best friend , capone must make some hard decisions in order to make things right again . \\ndirected deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne ( assistant director for such american films as how stella got her groove back and instinct ) , one hardly notices the film was shot on video after a while . \\nshots are handled so efficiently that they quickly take on the nuances of the aforementioned john woo films , although the action isn't as hyperkinetic as most of woo's films are . \\nthe action scenes are handled with a kind of flair though , and eventually begin to take on a life of their own ( beyond the hong kong films that they are obviously patterned after ) . \\nthe make-up effects are particularly good in these scenes as well , with flawless squib work on display from the effects team . \\nthe cast is superb and listening to their dialogue , spoken with thick jamaican accents ( half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive use of slang ) , just adds to the interest . \\npaul campbell , as the `loose cannon' capone , essays his role perfectly , displaying the right amount of menace and compassion at the right times . \\nmark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty , the part-time gun smuggler who is also trying to help the community by building football fields and organizing block parties to bring people together . \\nunfortunately , carl bradshaw is given the least to do and his character as the crime boss seems ineffective ( largely because his underlings seem to run all over him ) , but then again , that could be the way his character was intended to be portrayed . \\nthe music in the film is composed of all reggae songs , and the soundtrack was produced by grammy award winning artists , sly and robbie ( who have worked with the likes of the rolling stones , maxi priest , bob dylan , james brown , grace jones , herbie hancock , bootsy collins , and carly simon among others ) . \\nthe end credit song , `we run tings' , by the group red dragon , is pretty decent and carries on the theme of the movie established early on by the quote that opens this review . \\noddly enough , desmond ballentine ( who plays the character deportee ) is well known as a pioneer in the realm of `gangsta' reggae as the performer ninjaman , and he doesn't contribute a single song to the film ( that i could see ) , which is virtually unheard of here in the us . \\nat the time of this writing , third world cop has been put into limited theatrical release in the us , coming off of a six-month box-office breaking run in jamaica , where it holds the position as highest grossing film of all time ( bringing in $21 million in jamaica , which is roughly $500 , 000 us ) . \\npalm pictures ( the company that released the offbeat , but entertaining six-string samurai ) is the company releasing the film and considering that their main focus is the dvd market , i can imagine that a disc will be available once the film has left theaters . \\nchris blackwell , founder of palm pictures , was also involved in the production of another jamaican box-office smash in 1981 entitled countryman , so i'd say he has a pretty good track record . \\noverall , third world cop is a pretty entertaining homage to the films of john woo , ringo lam , tsui hark , and many other action films by directors from hong kong . \\nif action films are your thing and you don't mind intermittent subtitles , then you can't go wrong with this film . \\nthe performances and the story are solid ( if only a little cliched ) and the action is tight . \\ni'm not sure what the other jamaican films released in that country are like , but apparently third world cop's honors are well deserved . \\n\",\n",

\\nnever fear -- ferrara finds time for some female full frontal nudity to remind us what he\\'s all about . \\ni can picture it now . \\n \" take off yer clothes , kid -- it\\'s essential to depict the inner maelstrom of my central protagonist , and you\\'re his visual id . \\nyou\\'re the soul , the heart , the bloodstream of the picture . \\ntake it off ! \\ntake it all off ! ! ! \\nha ha ha ! \" \\nfriggin\\' vampire . \\nyeah , you , ferrara . \\na final word about matthew modine : he\\'s actually a fine actor when properly cast , but there\\'s something too squeaky-clean in his demeanor . \\nhe\\'s ideally suited for sarcastic men in tightly controlled situations , such as his private joker in full metal jacket or the time-bomb nebbish in short cuts ( who is every bit as superb as julianne moore in that famous scene , though no one seems to notice him ) . \\n[he was in that scene ? \\n-ed . ] \\nhere , he\\'s asked to let it all hang out , sporting a three-day stubble and oily bangs . \\nhe throws around furniture like stanley kowalski , but it\\'s somehow lacking . \\nmodine lacks the feral intensity of brando , entirely miscast in ferrara\\'s flesh fair . \\nbetter luck next time , matt . \\nsomeday , you\\'ll be forgiven for cutthroat island , which wasn\\'t really your fault in the first place . \\nmaybe atom egoyan will find a place for you somewhere , and all will once again be well in your world . \\n',\n",

       "  b'the thirteenth floor , the third in what i would call \" the reality check movie series \" , is very similar to the other reality check movies released this year , the matrix and existenz . \\nall three made you think , made you wonder what is real , what isn\\'t , and if our world is just a huge game . \\nthe thirteenth floor doesn\\'t reach the level of originality , creativity , and curiosity sparked by the matrix and existenz , but it certainly gives a great shot at it . \\nin the matrix , we were told that the humans are simply a virus . \\nin existenz , we learned that our life could be just a game . \\nin the thirteenth floor , we learn that we are just electronic devices , living under another world of electronic devices . \\nthere is just one world on top of another , and everything in them are fake and electronically generated . \\nthe thirteenth floor took a huge , risky turn that i didn\\'t expect it to take , and i\\'m not very sure it was such a great turn to make . \\nrather than focusing just on the reality parts of the film , the thirteenth floor becomes a murder mystery that ends up tying in with the different worlds . \\nafter the mysterious murder of computer program designer hammond fuller , played by armin mueller-stahl , douglas hall , played by craig bierko , a man that worked under fuller for many years , must travel through an electronic computer device that fuller was using , to the year 1937 , which consists of computer generated characters only . \\nthe simulation of 1937 is just like it was back in the olden days . \\nall of the people involved are just characters , or are they ? \\ndouglas strongly believes that a character traveled through the transport from their world to ours , and killed fuller . \\nalong the way , douglas interacts with many different potential suspects , and a woman who claims to be the daughter of fuller , jane fuller , played wonderfully by a talented young actress , gretchen mol . \\nthe thirteenth floor is a plot driven movie from the time the film gets going , and doesn\\'t use spectacular special effects and big sound to keep the viewer\\'s interests . \\ni was worried that this film would be too much like the matrix and existenz , and i wouldn\\'t enjoy it , but there were enough twists and turns to keep me thinking and attentive to the film . \\nunfortunately , many potential would have been great scenes were thrown away with predictable content , letting the viewer know the outcome of the scene long before it happened . \\nthe scenes that aren\\'t original or interesting seem to go absolutely nowhere , leaving you wondering , \" what is the point of this ? \" \\nsometimes it was hard to believe that this story , with terrible dialogue , some bad acting , especially from craig bierko , and scenes that go absolutely nowhere , are actually true . \\ni know this isn\\'t a true story or anything , but a film should be able to make you think that it is . \\non the plus side of acting , we get to see the missing from main character action since the film masterpiece shine in 1995 actor , armin mueller-stahl . \\nin the thirteenth floor , he is back and is still giving believable and amazing performances . \\nanother plus is gretchen mol\\'s realistic performance , creating her character with depth , not just staying in the one-dimensional phase . \\ndon\\'t expect the intensity of the matrix or existenz to come out of the thirteenth floor , just expect another film that messes with your mind for awhile , and shuts you down like any other movie would . \\nthrills , chills , and spills aren\\'t what you will get in this film , but you will just get another trip to send your mind on , scrambling it until you\\'ve had enough . \\nthe bottom line- let\\'s hope this is the last of the \" reality check \" based movies for awhile . \\n',\n",
       "  b'here is a film that is so unexpected , so scary , and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop . \\nokay , it isn\\'t quite original , considering it is a sequel to the box office hit species , but it certainly is smart . \\nmost films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy b-horror films from the 50s and 60s , and some even become them . \\nhowever , as we learned with the 1995 small-budget horror/sci-fi film , sometimes expectations can be shattered . \\na lot of criticism has gone against this film ( from what i have read so far , anyway--yep , all two reviews ) , and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory , laughable pieces of trash . \\nbut , the thing is , it isn\\'t . \\nit\\'s well made , well acted , and quite intelligent . \\ni can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film . \\nbut the species series isn\\'t about the lack of these elements . \\nit\\'s about how much it can get into one film . \\nand yet , behind it all , it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so . \\nspecies ii begins in the present day , though it seems to be an alternate universe . \\nmany films ( especially sci-fi ones ) create similar timelines as our realistic one , but change it to fit the film\\'s needs . \\nspecies ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft , the excursion , landing on the surface of mars . \\naboard is patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , a very bright and very handsome astronaut . \\npatrick is the son of senator ross ( james cromwell ) , who just wants patrick to succeed . \\nwell , it would seem that he has succeeded . \\nlanding on the surface of mars , he is the first human being to ever do so . \\nof course , he isn\\'t the first ever . \\nabout a billion years ago , an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life . \\nnow , of course , the red planet is cold and rocky . \\nno life lives on it . \\nthat is , no visible life . \\npatrick , upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil , collects samples from the ground . \\nhe takes them aboard , and puts them in storage . \\nunfortunately , one of the samples contains a form of life , and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship . \\njust prior to heading back to earth , this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings . \\nthey pass out for approximately seven minutes , and then shrug it off as nothing , because they can\\'t even remember . \\nthey blame it on a technical malfunction . \\nback on earth , patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible . \\nas we know from the original , this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet . \\nhowever , the children that are bred are half-human , as their father is . \\npatrick is really looking for another alien to breed with , and he finds it in eve ( natasha henstridge ) . \\neve was cloned from dna taken from sil , the original alien . \\nhowever , this time around , most of her \" alien \" urges have been either decreased dramatically , or lie dormant . \\nthe project is led by dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , reprising her role from species ) , and her motives seem respectable . \\nsince she was involved with the original alien attack , she wants to learn how to stop the alien should it come again . \\nand it has . \\nstory-wise , species ii is much stronger than its predecessor , but it is also much stronger than , say , aliens ( hey , i love the film , but you can\\'t tell me it was strong on story ) . \\nwhat surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay . \\nin my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college , we learned about a piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles . \\nthis piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars ( later , it was proven that it was not a living creature that created it ) . \\nthe script uses this effectively , but also manages to provide a well-balanced plot . \\nbeginning with the first man on mars ( something i have always dreamed of seeing ) , i was hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie . \\nand it does it quite well . \\nthe characters are all smart , and they know what to do and what not to do . \\nthe only character that seems a little cliched is the general ( george dzundza ) , and yet , he remains logical in everything he does . \\nthere are the obvious flaws of course , mostly lying in the technical aspects . \\nthe special effects are only mediocre , and some are just plain bad . \\nbut for the most part , they remain believable ( i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children ) . \\nalso , the most realistic ones are usually the goriest , ranging from people being torn open , or someone\\'s head being blown off . \\nhowever , some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience , including a menage a troi that is all but necessary . \\nmany people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex , nudity , and gory violence . \\nhowever , i tend to disagree . \\nwhat were the alien films about ? \\nand , if an alien species ever did come to earth , and their sole purpose was to destroy us , wouldn\\'t you mate as quickly as possible with as many people as possible ? \\nmy only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery store . \\ni didn\\'t realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with ( i just assume it is his part-human side looking for the most beautiful one ) . \\nthe acting is quite good for this kind of film . \\nit is a vast improvement over the first film , at least . \\nthe acting is the key element to this film : if it was bad , it would have lowered itself into camp ; if it was good , it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens . \\nokay , so it isn\\'t that good . \\ngeorge dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting , as his over-the-top impersonation of a general makes him annoying and distracting . \\nnatasha henstridge is limited this time around , as she is usually enclosed in a cage . \\nhowever , she does manage a very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent . \\noh yeah , and she\\'s quite fun to just plain watch . \\nmarg helgenberger is immensely better this time around , and her performance is probably the best in this film . \\nmichael madsen is so-so , but he isn\\'t annoying , and he soon becomes rather appealing ( with his nice cynic personality ) . \\njames cromwell has a small part , but he makes it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable actor . \\nas i say , any film with james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability . \\nmykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performance , and he gives the film a more down-to-earth feel . \\nand , of course , justin lazard . \\nlazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance , but i think he is effective . \\nsure , he is wooden , but isn\\'t that what his character is like ? \\nthe moment when he touches the glass separating henstridge from him was extremely well done , due to the couple\\'s acting . \\nspecies ii is rated r for strong sexuality , sci-fi violence/gore and language . \\nthis is definitely an r rated film that young kids should not see . \\nmore than likely , they would probably have nightmares and never have sex for the rest of their lives . \\nhell , i don\\'t even know if i will . \\nwhat is sure to be a critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film of the year . \\ni probably won\\'t see another film where i was expecting so little and got so much for quite a while . \\ndirector peter medak has crafted a very suspenseful , and sometimes very scary movie out of a mediocre series . \\nmedak has also mastered the wonderful \" jump ! \" \\nmoments , and has probably the second scariest moment i have ever seen on film ( scream still has the first ) . \\nstrong acting , smart dialogue , intelligent plotting , and a sure-handed director , species ii is exactly what these films should be : entertaining . \\n',\n",

       "  b'zero effect gets its title from the main character , daryl zero ( bill pullman ) , although we don\\'t understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film . \\nzero is a private investigator , perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived ( at least he\\'d like to think so ) . \\nhowever , he\\'s a socially inept being , and eccentric in every possible way -- this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than they already are . \\nzero\\'s accomplice is steve arlo ( ben stiller ) , a \" normal \" guy who does the business side of the job -- he\\'s the one who actually speaks to clients and explains zero\\'s greatness as an investigator . \\nthe opening scene has steve explaining the many virtues of zero\\'s talents to soon-to-be client gregory stark ( ryan o\\'neal ) . \\nit turns out that stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box , and is now being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about . \\nzero takes the case , and the plot thickens . \\nhis path leads to a young , pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan ( kim dickens ) . \\ndespite her luminous and seemingly-harmless presence , she turns out to be the one blackmailing stark . \\nthrough his investigations , zero learns why , but not without developing feelings for gloria -- feelings that , because of his reclusive behavior , are new and confusing to him . \\ni have no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film . \\ni can idly enjoy movies about private investigators , and , every once in a while , a film like chinatown comes a long that blows me away ( actually , no private eye film has ever reached chinatown\\'s greatness ) . \\nzero effect , which is jake kasdan\\'s first effort as writer/director , is a film about a private investigator that succeeds in all attempts : it\\'s an original , funny , and completely involving motion picture . \\nwith so many cliches available to this genre , i find it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them . \\nbut he didn\\'t just successfully avoid flaws : he has created a great film here , one that had me interested and fascinated from the first shot to the final moment . \\ntake , for starters , the great cast of characters . \\npullman is terrific as zero , showing a comic flair that i really haven\\'t seen from him since spaceballs . \\nzero is the kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he does here ; the fact that he\\'s an almost exaggeratedly twisted , emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe . \\npullman\\'s performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance , and the occasional voice-over as he\\'s going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious . \\nben stiller is also a very funny individual ; he\\'s the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny . \\n \" i\\'ll shoot you , \" he says to stark at one point . \\n \" i have a gun , and everything . \" \\nhis character is also well-drawn , with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend ( angela featherstone ) who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job . \\no\\'neal also gives his character a bit of depth ; and kim dickens , last seen ( and underused ) in mercury rising , gets a chance to show us her talent here , giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs . \\ni find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film . \\nkasdan\\'s humor is of the best kind -- soft spoken , and mostly dialogue-driven ( though there are some great visual jokes ) . \\nit\\'s the kind of humor that\\'s funny even after you\\'ve seen it five or six times . \\nthere\\'s one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is , an how that makes him such a great detective . \\nwhat we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed , or standing motionlessly , with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face , his eyes pointing to something off camera , but obviously to nothing in particular . \\ni can\\'t convey to you how funny this is , but what makes it great film making is that it has a point -- scenes like this are frequent , and they provide solid characterization of zero . \\nas a side note , i don\\'t consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy ( not to sound elitist ) -- i find things funny that many do not , and vice versa . \\nthere was a clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film , and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it . \\ni have a feeling the humor here won\\'t appeal to everyone , but there\\'s certainly enough story and character development to keep anyone\\'s interest . \\njake kasdan , son of writer/director lawrence kasdan , is only 22 years old . \\ni found this out after seeing the film , and i can\\'t remember ever being so impressed with a film maker . \\nhis direction is stylish without being pretentious , and his writing is mature , full , and developed . \\nzero effect is the kind of film that i\\'ll buy for my collection -- smart , original films like this are rare as it is , but this one actually has a heart and a soul . \\nat the end of the film , i was involved in the characters , and i was satisfied with the outcome . \\nand , with kasdan\\'s undeniable talent at such a young age , all i can do is hope to see a lot more from him in the future . \\n',\n",
       "  b'about an hour or so into \" the jackal , \" a character wandered around as people were being shot at in a big suspense sequence , and one of the audience members in the theatre i saw it in shouted out \" i hope she gets killed now ! \" \\nat that point it hit me : i didn\\'t care for any of the characters being played by actors i didn\\'t really like . \\nwhen the sole reason you care about a character being played by sidney poitier in a suspense film is because he\\'s being played by sidney poitier , you know something\\'s rotten in the state of denmark . \\nevery year , a couple films like this are released . \\nyou know : the cheap , action packed international espionnage film , featuring a semi-promising premise , some big-name actors ( usually bruce willis ) , and the hopes that some audience members will forget the cold war ended several years ago . \\nthis was the third one of \\'97 , following the very lackluster \" the saint , \" which featured an amoral costume changing bond wannabe ; and the surprisingly fun \" the peacemaker , \" featuring clooney and kidman trying to stop an almost untraceable villain . \\n \" the jackal \" tries to mix both elements . \\nand you thought \" the saint \" was bad . \\n \" the jackal \" is loosely ( very loosely , i hope ) based on the 1973 fred zimmerman classic that i\\'ve yet to see , \" the day of the jackal , \" which featured ( apparently ) a suave hitman called the jackal , played by edward fox , trying to assasinate charles degaule . \\nwell , welcome to the 90s , where a sorta suave hitman , also called the jackal ( bruce willis ) , trying to kill the head of the fbi . . . or \\nis he ? \\nafter being hired by a russian mob lord as a bit of vengeance for the murder of his brother ( killed in the opening scenes ) , the jackal romps all over the northen hemisphere , from helsinki to virginia , setting up an elaborate scheme wherein he\\'ll be able to assasinate this person and still get away to live in seclusion . \\nand like the saint , the jackal changes his look over and over and over again to elude people . \\nthe agent working on the case , cater preston ( sidney poitier - yes , that sidney poitier ) , working with a russian agent , valentina koslova ( diane venora - lady capulet from \" romeo + juliet \" ) , gives up early on and meets with an ex-ira man , declan mulqueen ( richard gere , putting up some tight competition between himself and brad pitt for worst fake irish accent of \\'97 ) who\\'s in a massachusetts jail , but who has apparently seen the jackal , who has been eluding the law forever . \\nsoon , he\\'s out working with the two untrusting agents , and trying to help them catch him . \\nthere are numerous problems with the film , and which one is the biggest one is pretty impossible to put a finger on . \\nthe film is supposed to be a big suspense thriller , but save a couple moments , the film never achieves suspense , or even a sense of intrigue . \\nsure , the big assasination attempt is a bit cool looking and even slightly tense , but every other scene in the film is too short and too dull to register . \\nthe film never picks up enough to become a thrilling experience , or even an entertaining one . \\nit doesn\\'t help that the plot is designed to be complex , but falls into so many problems , like plot holes and unbelievable circumstances . \\nthe script of \" the jackal \" is a complete mess , mostly because it can\\'t decide what it wants to focus on . \\nis this a film about a man trying to find redemption by catching a nasty killer ? \\nis it a film about a nasty , amoral hitman who\\'s in everything for the money ? \\nor is it a combination of both ? \\n \" the jackal \" aims for the latter , but never focuses in on either character . \\nthe connection between the two feels completely edited , so much that in a scene when the jackal turns around and notices declan , you wonder how he recognized him so fast . \\nthe worst part is the little past they try to give declan , most notably his relationship with an old girlfriend , isabella ( mathilda may ) , given so little screen time that you almost forget her character exists until she pops up every now and then . \\nthe supporting characters are worse . \\nsidney poitier is given a completely unplayable role , that of a man who is just stern sometimes , and other times more giving and likable . \\nwhat is poitier doing here ? \\nhe\\'s one of the best living actors ! \\ndoes he really need to waste his time doing drivel like this ? \\ndiane venora\\'s russian character is almost as bad , with a cigarette perpetually in her mouth , and a plastered on expressionless facade . \\nit\\'s not that anyone\\'s bad here ; it\\'s that they have nothing to do . \\nthe plot is a joke , feeling like it was pasted together by someone in post-production who dropped each scene on the floor and pasted them together quickly so it could be released on time . \\nthe jackal himself is not even much of an international villain . \\nthere are several times where he\\'s in a tight situation and makes things worse for himself , the only explanation being that the filmmakers wanted to toss in a cheap thrill . \\ntake a scene where he\\'s being followed by some agents into a parking garage : he quickly sprays his car another color , and adds a solvent that if touched kills the person who touched it . \\ndoesn\\'t killing someone attract more attention than it does distract ? \\nand does he think dying his hair bottle blond makes him fit in in a public place ? \\ngeez ! \\nis there anything good here ? \\nwell . . . a \\ncouple things . \\ni did like willis\\'s icy expressions ; he may not have been real suave or anything , but some of his looks are worth a chuckle . \\nrichard gere has a couple of good moments , making his character as likable as he possibly could have . \\nand a couple sequences are kicky in that kind of proposterous , completely inane but fun kinda way , most notably : a sequence where he tests out a new gun on an annoying gun builder ( jack black ) ; and a bit where he seduces a gay washington man , which has its share of a couple good jokes , most particular a kiss by willis . \\nbut none of these elevate the film any higher than it could go ; they\\'re just little distractions along the way to amuse us mildly then toss us back into the world of dullness and stupidity that is \" the jackal . \" \\ndirector michael caton-jones ( who directed the far superior \" rob roy \" ) has made a film that is made very couple months , one that is unentertaining , unintriguing , and pretty much cold , but will nevertheless make money because , hey , the trailers do make it look like it may be fun in that kind of retro-clancy kinda way . \\nevery now and then , the filmmakers get it right ( \" clear and present danger , \" which was enormous fun in that smart kinda way ) , but \" the jackal \" is an example of when they go completely wrong . \\n',\n",

       "  b'a new entry in the \" revisionist history \" genre of filmmaking , dick suggests that two not-too-bright teenage girls are the cause of the uncovering of the nation\\'s biggest presidential scandal . \\nkirsten dunst and michelle williams star betsy and arlene , who while trying to deliver a fan letter from arlene\\'s watergate hotel room , accidentally stumble across g . gordon liddy ( played dead-on by harry shearer ) and the infamous break-in . \\nwhen they recognize liddy later on during a white house field trip , they are ushered into a conference room , questioned as to what they know , and leave as official presidential dog walkers . \\nthe girls manage to unwittingly uncover every bit of the watergate scandal while performing their duties , but have no clue as to what they are getting involved with . \\nwhen they discover that nixon ( another dead-on performance by dan hedaya , who actually favors nixon slightly , unlike anthony hopkins ) has been abusive to checkers , the presidential dog , thanks to the conversations that he always recorded , they quit and become disillusioned . \\nduring a prank phone call the girls make to woodward and bernstein , events are set into motion that eventually lead to the president\\'s resignation . \\nthis film starts off promisingly with an aged woodward and bernstein arguing with each other on an obvious larry king-type talk show ( featuring a cameo by french stewart ) about revealing the identity of \" deep throat \" . \\nfrom there , we are subjected to bodily function humor and just about every bad \" dick \" joke one can derive from this type of supposed comedy . \\nat one point , the girls are having to scream over a high school band playing on the steps of the lincoln memorial . \\nthe band manages to stop right as dunst screams \" you have to stop letting dick run your life ! \" \\nmuch to the horror of everyone standing within earshot . \\nseveral other variations on this wordplay surface all throughout the film . \\nif this movie had been smarter i would have been less likely to fault it\\'s juvenile bathroom humor , but it\\'s not . \\nthe film was apparently made for relatively younger people because every major player in the watergate scandal is introduced and shoved down the audience\\'s throat in the least subtle way possible . \\ni don\\'t recall oliver stone\\'s nixon having to pander to it\\'s audience , but of course that film wasn\\'t a comedy aimed squarely at a 13-20 year-old film going audience . \\nthe only redeeming thing about this movie is it\\'s remarkable supporting cast . \\ni wanted to see more of ferrell and mcculloch\\'s woodward and bernstein . \\nthose two characters are the sole basis for my rating . \\ni wish they had been given more screen time , but unfortunately , they are only relegated to the final half-hour . \\ntheir constant bickering and fighting over trying to get the story are a major highlight , especially mcculloch\\'s constant thwarting of ferrell\\'s attempts to gather information from the girls ( who , in the course of the narrative are revealed as deep throat , so named thanks to an ill planned trip to a porno theater by betsy\\'s brother ) . \\nthe other members of the cast are excellent in their portrayals of their particular characters , but are given nothing to work with . \\ni\\'d like to see the same cast portray these characters in a script more suited towards their comedic abilities . \\nas for the two leads , dunst and williams can definitely do better . \\nthey come off as what could best be described as romy and michele : the early years in this particular film , a highly dubious distinction at best . \\nstay through the first half of the end credits though , to see an interesting scene involving dunst and williams suggestively sucking on lollipops emblazoned with the title of the movie . \\nan excellent idea marred by poor execution , dick could have been a great movie . \\nless of the juvenile humor and more of the smarter comedy displayed by the woodward and bernstein scenes , could have made this film a wonderful satire of the nixon presidency as seen through the eyes of two naive fifteen year olds . \\nas it stands though , dick offers nothing but what filmmaker kevin smith so accurately defines as \" dick and poopie \" jokes . \\nand that , to me , does not make a funny movie . \\n[pg-13] \\n',\n",

       "  b'slavery is bad . \\nafter hundreds of years , we\\'ve finally figured that one out . \\nthis almost universal belief is the both the strength and weakness of director steven spielberg\\'s latest \" serious \" film . \\nduring the late 1830s , a portuguese slave ship carries a cargo of black men and women kidnapped from their home on africa\\'s west coast to cuba to be sold into slavery . \\nfifty-three of them are stuffed into the \" la amistad \" ( from a spanish word for \" friendship \" ) by their new spanish owners . \\nfreeing himself from his chains , senge pieh ( djimon hounsou ) , renamed cinque by his masters , leads a bloody revolt . \\nafter killing most of the crew , the africans force the remaining sailors to return them to their home - or so they think . \\ninstead the ship heads up the coast to the united states . \\nthe amistad is boarded by an american naval ship and the revolutionaries are put on trial in connecticut for murder and piracy . \\nthe legal question becomes are they free men fighting justly for their freedom or are they property . \\nif they are property , who do they belong to ? \\ntheir masters ? \\nthe spanish government ? \\nsalvage rights of the officers who captured the ship ? \\nthe us government ? \\nthe defendants are pawns in several games . \\nabolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) want to free them , but tappan sees them primarily as a means to further the cause . \\ntheir lawyer roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) views the case as a simple one of property rights and a chance to make his share of legal fees . \\nsouth carolina senator john c . calhoun ( arliss howard ) pursues the case for the political advancement of the southern states . \\npresident martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) is willing to force the result towards his own political ends . \\nwhen the verdict looks to free the africans , van buren replaces the judge with one more sympathetic to his wishes . \\neven that doesn\\'t work and the new judge frees the kidnap victims . \\nat the urging of calhoun , the president then appeals the case to the supreme court , populated by a majority of slave-owners . \\nthis little-known ( try finding it in any history text book ) incident from america\\'s past would have gone down a darker path were it not for former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) who is persuaded to argue the case before the supreme court . \\nthe slavery issue is easy pickin\\'s for spielberg . \\nmuch like his \" shindler\\'s list \" ( which followed \" jurassic park \" as this follows \" lost world \" ) , the moral sides are not difficult ones to choose . \\nnazis and slave traders : both treat groups of others as less than human . \\nit\\'s not hard to see who the bad guys are . \\nwithout that question to ponder , the director\\'s job is more difficult . \\nhe has to make the story interesting . \\nspielberg succeeds for the most part . \\nthe visual aspect of the film is beyond reproach . \\nwhere the movie falls down is a bit more subtle . \\nthere are very few _people_ in the tale . \\nin fact , cinque is the only character who is fleshed out . \\ntappan and joadson are \" abolitionists \" : symbols but not humans . \\nvan buren is a weak politician but nothing else . \\nthe rest of the \" slaves \" barely exist other than dressing for the set . \\nlike many other films about people of color , almost all the major players are white . \\nthe film\\'s salvation lies in the acting strength of everyone involved and the powerful presence of hounsou . \\nthe former model\\'s first major role is a winner . \\nwithout speaking more than five words of english , he conveys more emotion than most actors with a thousand lines of dialog . \\nthe other stand-out is hopkins who seems to be making a career out of portraying american presidents ( he also played the title role in \" nixon \" ) . \\nthe impassioned speech by the doddering old man who phases in and out of rationality is among the best court-room drama ever on the screen . \\nthere are some other great moments . \\nespecially impressive are the african\\'s struggle to understand what is going on in the strange land . \\ntheir interpretation of the bible based solely on the pictures and their own experiences is poignant . \\nas grand as the epic is , it would have more impact had it focused more on the experience from the point of view of the africans . \\nmore humanity in the fight for humanity would have made it a four-star film . \\n ( michael redman has written this column for a real long time and is just now getting around to seeing some 1998 films . ) \\n',\n",

       "  b\"earth is a harsh , unconsoling drama about the time when india gained independence from britain and the ensuing turmoil that engulfed the subcontinent . \\npeople who supposedly loved the same land and the same god found themselves in bitter conflict , as the country divided into factions fighting in the streets : indian and pakistani ; muslim , hindu , sikh , parsee . \\nthe story takes place in lahore , which was indian before partition , and pakistani afterward , regardless of what its citizens might call themselves . \\nthe action is seen through the eyes of lenny ( maaia sethna ) , a young parsee girl , but it is really about her nanny , shanta . \\nshanta has a small circle of male admirers . \\ntwo of the men are suitors : hasan ( rahul khanna ) , a hindu , and dil navaz ( aamir khan ) , a muslim . \\nthe others--sikh , hindu , muslim--are older ; some are married ; but all appreciate shanta , who is played by the stirringly beautiful nandita das . \\n ( she also starred in deepa mehta's previous film , fire , the first part of a thematic trilogy which will conclude with water . ) \\nin an early scene , the men are sitting in a park talking with shanta and lenny ; political tension in the country is growing as the day of independence nears . \\none of the men remarks , jokingly , that their little group is probably one of the last places in the city where the different religions can still get along . \\nhe is wrong : the men make barbed little comments to each other , spoken like jokes , but with an undercurrent of fanaticism . \\nthe tenor of these exchanges grows darker and more bitter as the movie progresses . \\nit is easy to perceive , in these squabbles , the trajectory which ends in mass violence and slaughter . \\nthe group around shanta represents , in a sense , a united india , and shanta herself the ideal motherland--one which all love , which inspires hindu , muslim , and sikh to live peacably together . \\nbut the circle around shanta is sundered , as is the state . \\na sikh is persecuted , hides , then flees . \\nanother man is murdered . \\nthe group of friends will not meet again . \\nthe movie is rife with images of breakage and destruction : a plate shattered on the floor , a stuffed toy torn apart by an upset child , and , most brutally , when the tension escalates into violence , a man is held down , tied between two cars , and ripped in half by the opposing movement of the vehicles . \\nit is a visceral and effective metaphor for a country which is being destroyed just as painfully . \\nthe crux of earth's plot is the transformation undergone by dil navaz . \\nhis sisters are killed in brutal fashion , by hindus , because they are muslim . \\ndil navaz seeks solace from shanta , and asks in desperation that she marry him . \\nbut she loves hasan , and tenderly refuses dil navaz's offer . \\nthe combination of familial anguish and romantic rejection twists inside him , and it is easy to see how he is seduced by the growing mob mentality : the muslim cause gives him a motive to vent his anger and hate . \\ndespite the things he later does , it is to the credit of earth that it does not simply denounce dil navaz and those like him , but shows how circumstances can make decent enough men do monstrous things . \\nthe conclusion--the consequence of dil navaz's transformation--is rather abrupt . \\nthe story earth tells does not end . \\nit just stops . \\nit is an appropriate finish : giving us closure would have imparted , at least on an aesthetic level , a sense of resolution , of satisfaction . \\nbut there was no resolution for india and pakistan--they have been at war , on a small or large scale , for decades . \\nsince the personal dramas in earth mirror the political struggles of a nation , it is only right that those dramas should have no terminus . \\nthere is no healing to be had , no closure , on any level ( despite the needless , tacked-on ending , with voice-over narration from lenny as an adult , framing the story ) . \\nearth is , in some ways , an unexceptional movie . \\nit does not reinvent the wheel , following instead the standard pattern of historical dramas . \\nbut deepa mehta's directon is assured , and the issues she addresses run deep . \\nearth does for india what movies like zhang yimou's to live and tian zhuangzhuang's the blue kite did for china : they show us the agonies endured by unremarkable people who had the bad luck to be caught up and smashed in the crucible of history . \\nsuch films strike me as inherently valuable , even when flawed . \\nthey may be biased or inaccurate , but they bear the weight of human hardship , and this confers on them a nobility and gravity which other , more inventive films , often lack . \\nit is notable that all three movies were banned in their native countries : the events shown may have happened decades ago , but they still touch a nerve . \\nthe issues tackled in earth have a particular urgency in light of the nuclear test bombings that took place last year . \\nin the near future , india and pakistan may launch nuclear missiles at each other . \\nat the time of the tests i had some understanding of the reasons why this might happen ;

       "  b'it seemed wholly appropriate that at a weekend screening of \" the horse whisperer , \" the start of the film was delayed some twenty minutes due to \" projection difficulties . \" \\nrobert redford\\'s film version of nicholas evans\\' best-selling novel was supposed to have been in theaters last december , going head-to-head with \" titanic , \" but is only now making its much anticipated debut . \\nthis ( strategic ? ) \\ndelay has allowed \" the horse whisperer \" to compete , sans fanfare , against some smaller , unassuming movies during a relatively slower time at the box office . \\nno matter . \\nredford\\'s film stands head and shoulders above james cameron\\'s ocean-going tragedy , especially in the writing and acting departments . \\nwhatever the reasons for its postponement , \" the horse whisperer \" supports the old adage \" better late than never . \" \\nredford has taken evans\\' book and given it the big screen treatment . \\nwhile parts of \" the horse whisperer \" are epic in scope and vision , especially the aerial \" travelogue \" that maps out this great country of ours , its real strength lies in the subtleties it uses to paint the fragile alliance between man and beast . \\nwhen her daughter , grace , is involved in a terrible riding accident , hard-driven fashion editor annie maclean ( kristin scott thomas ) devotes herself to rehabilitating both grace and grace\\'s beloved horse , pilgrim . \\nrefusing to have the hideously disfigured animal put down , annie researches every possible source of information about equine cures before discovering an article about a faith-healing cowboy of sorts called tom booker ( redford ) , who has a way with horses and , perhaps , with people too . \\nundeterred by tom\\'s initial reluctance to get involved , annie drives grace and a sedated pilgrim across country to meet him , and finally persuades tom to work with the uncontrollable animal . \\nredford\\'s film unfolds slowly and lovingly , echoing the patience required in healing both physical and psychological wounds . \\nthe film\\'s a little long and , even if you haven\\'t read the book , it\\'s pretty obvious where it\\'s heading--but these are minor complaints . \\nredford and thomas are strong and convincing as the couple drawn by a mutual affection for the great outdoors and each other , but it\\'s scarlett johansson as grace who shines in a more difficult role . \\ndianne wiest , chris cooper ( \" lone star \" ) , and sam neill--better than i\\'ve seen him before--round out the respectable supporting cast . \\nand the director\\'s respect for horses is clearly in evidence . \\none word of warning , however : while brilliantly shot , the accident scene , involving an out-of-control truck , is extremely disturbing . \\nredford\\'s canvas is huge and exquisite . \\nhe doesn\\'t hesitate to incorporate vast , sprawling vistas of the american northwest : spectacular , snow-capped mountain ranges , azure skies , and shimmering fields of wheat--all are resplendent in cinematographer robert richardson\\'s viewfinder . \\nveteran english composer john barry was originally signed to score the film but left the project which is a pity , since \" the horse whisperer \" is \" dances with wolves \" by way of \" out of africa \" ( oscar winners both for barry ) . \\nfortunately , barry\\'s replacement , thomas newman , contributes a fine score that nicely balances the majesty of montana with the delicate , human conditions--sonorous , string-laden passages that swell with pride playing counterpoint to more poetic , introspective movements ripe with nuance . \\n \" the horse whisperer \" is that rare kind of movie : it looks good , it feels good , and by golly it does you good . \\nthe wait , it turns out , was well worth it . \\n',\n",

\" \\nshe argues that the artist is the watchdog for the public , questioning what is good or evil in society , something that bad science has completely ignored . \\ngeoffrey , impatient to get ahead with his research , feels bogged down by the bureaucrats in his firm who fail to provide him with the three chimps he needs to experiment on , as he contacts one of the company\\'s higher ups to argue his case , but decides he can\\'t wait any longer for their help , so he sets an animal trap in the countryside and catches chester , the gorgeous pet dog of frances , a dog that means so much to her and her family because he saved her life . \\nwhile out in the field with the bloodied trapped dog already in the back seat of his car , he is spotted by alex and one of his co-workers , and nervously invites them to dinner with his wife , afraid that alex will spot what he is doing , as he rushes away from the area . \\nin the dinner scene that was , unfortunately , flatly done , but was nevertheless the heart of the film , as all the main characters get a chance to speak out from the point of view they represent as they eat meat , a means of getting protein that the radical scientists have eschewed since they became so politically correct about everything . \\nthe scientists engage in a rational argument , highlighting their different points of view , while lillian reacts in an emotional way , siding mostly with david\\'s view but coming at it from a much different angle . \\nit was as if the actors were puppets on strings that the director controlled and they just spewed out their generalized philosophies . \\nthat the director\\'s point of view is absolutely right , is beside the point . \\nthe point is that the characters lost their humanity and became one-dimensional characters . \\ngeoffrey was likened to a hideous monster , alex vine was likened to his last name , the one who holds fast to the ground ensuring that the plant has stability , while lillian was likened to the muse of poetry and art , the inspiration for goodness and beauty . \\nalex has been spending a lot of time together with lillian , as these two seem to share the same views and are physically attracted to each other , but when the time is ripe for an affair to take place between them , lillian changes her mind and decides not to go up to alex\\'s apartment . \\ngeoffrey is already suspicious of alex and considers him an enemy , and the marriage seems to be coming apart and all his cunning tricks to possess her are no longer working , as it is now impossible to see any good in him and there becomes no reason why she would remain with him . \\nthe relationship has disintegrated way beyond the point of her just feeling lonely . \\nthe dog is discovered by alex and her in a deplorable state after geoffrey is seen by them electrically shocking it , and mercifully the dog dies . \\nthe only thing left for her to do is walk out of the marriage , but she also fails to respond to david\\'s loving gesture for her to stay with him , instead opting to head back to the city . \\nthe farmer whose dog was tortured to death comes into the scientist\\'s lab and knocks him cold while he was in the middle of a phone conversation with one of the higher-ups who told him all the animals he needs are on the way . \\nwhat is progress ? \\nwhat can one expect out of life ? \\nis the small farmer about to become extinct ? \\nthe answers to these questions can best be answered by either good science or art , which are both closely related to the american natives vision of a world entrusted to mankind so that he can respect it and take care of it and enrich it with his creations to benefit mankind in a peaceful way . \\nthat this work fails to be subtle and polarizes opinions , leaving no room for deeper arguments , is the shame of this decent and smart film , that tried so hard to say what it felt it had to say but said it so loudly without trusting its audience to catch on to its message by not making everything seem so black and white . \\nno telling said a lot about the harmful trends it sees science going in ; it probably said too much and would have been better off if its vision was more poetical and less didactic . \\nthere is something about listening to a lecture that turns off the rebel in me , as i don\\'t like being hit in the head with the truth but prefer to have it presented in the form that leads to inspiration or told metaphorically . \\nthat is not to say that i found the film without considerable merit , that inspite of its shortcomings , it was worth seeing because of its visual statements , though they were also not too subtle , they were at least effective in setting up the intense mood that the film needed to show that there is a mental war going on currently , of those who believe one way is right and others who differ with them , and that anyone who is neutral must be considered an enemy because of their indifference . \\nthe stakes in this ecological struggle are that high . \\nperhaps the most powerful visual statement in the film , was the dead cow from pesticides shown in the opening scene . \\nit was the image that lillian spent her time painting all summer and had the same affect for her as did the animal faces in picasso\\'s guernica had for him . \\nboth artists envisioned the horrors that man could do against the world , and represented this unspoken pain on the faces of the animals so that anyone who cares to really see what is going on , will not mistake which side of the fence he or she should be on . \\nthe pain that lillian feels , as she forgets about her desires to raise a family , and she stares at her painting of the cow and the song , \" make the world go away \" blares out from the background , after she has learned that frances\\' beautiful and loving dog has been brutalized by her monster of a husband , all in the name of science , had a raw power to it that personalizes the dangers of bad science . \\nperhaps , the most pertinent question the film asks , requires an answer that must be resolved by the farmers and the consumers who are most caught in the changing world and its new way of doing business , as the question becomes , can science be happily married with art ?

       "  b'labelling is sometimes everything . \\nin original mad max , the opening title set the plot of the movie in near future , thus making it one of the science fiction classics , despite the future world being almost exactly like our own . \\nwalter hill wanted the same opening title for his action classic the warriors . \\nproducers weren\\'t thrilled by that idea and consequently the movie lost all of its futuristic overtones . \\non the other hand , producers were right on the mark ; walter hill was accused of actually promoting some disturbing trends that were quite visible in contemporary america . \\nto make the movie even more distant from future , plot was loosely based on anabasis , historical book written by xenophon , greek mercenary soldier who had described his adventures in ancient persia 2400 years ago . \\ninstead of ancient persia , movie begins in contemporary coney island , where cleon ( dorsey wright ) , leader of the warriors , local youth gang , gets invitation to the great gathering of all youth gangs from the city . \\nthe gathering , organised by gramercy park riffs , most powerful gang in the city , is taking place in bronx . \\nthat is far away from warriors\\' home territory , but small and unarmed delegation of the warriors gets there safely thanks to the general truce . \\non the gathering , cyrus ( roger hill ) , charismatic leader of the riffs , announces his grand plan to unite all the gangs and take over the city . \\ncrowd is enthusiastic , but the small gang of rogues , led by psychopathic luther ( david patrick kelly ) uses the opportunity to assassinate cyrus . \\npolice simultaneously raids the gathering , and in the commotion warriors get blamed by the killing , and their leader gets killed by riffs . \\nthe remaining eight , led by cleon\\'s lieutenant swann ( michael beck ) , must now try to get to coney island , but this time unprotected by truce and instead being chased by all the gangs . \\nupon its release , despite the controversies and even some youth riots that were allegedly inspired by it , the warriors enjoyed immense popularity and very quickly received some kind of a cult status . \\nhowever , despite being one of the best movies of that year , and being directed by talented action director walter hill at the peak of his career , the movie failed to leave as strong impression to the future generations as some other cinematic achievements of that same year . \\nthe reason for that probably lies in a fact that this movie aged very quickly . \\nif walter hill\\'s idea was to warn the public about problems of urban america , he failed miserably . \\nthe future was much worse than his vision . \\nthe youth gangs , as presented in the warriors , are far from shadowy armies , able to take over entire cities . \\ntheir members seem more interested in unorthodox fashion and their little petty feuds than such prosaic , and for the public more annoying , matters like crime . \\nin their vocabulary , word \" arms \" is reserved for small knives and blunt objects , and only few of them use heavy artillery like handguns . \\nthey even have their own , very strict and detailed laws , upheld more strictly than some governments do with their own . \\nmany people in american cities would be more than happy to see their young criminals behaving like those in the warriors . \\nsome of the critics who accused hill of actually praising youth crime had a lot arguments in their favour . \\ndespite those objections , the warriors have all the elements of a very good film . \\nthe plot is simple , and serves as good basis for numerous action scenes . \\nthe fights are brilliantly choreographed and quite realistic , although there isn\\'t much bloodshed or gore in the movie . \\nediting is superb , events happen at quick pace , with the exception of middle , when boring moralistic exchanges between swann and his would-be-girlfriend mercy ( deborah van valkenburgh ) drag the plot from straight action to social drama territory . \\nthe soundtrack by barry de vorzon is very suggestive and recognisable . \\nyet , the trademark of this film are the actors who showed great talent , although most of them later sunk into anonymity . \\nbest known of them is david patrick kelly , whose superb and original performance in this film later subscribed him to the roles of psychopathic villains . \\nmichael beck as cool , almost statesman-like leader of a gang , is also very good , and james remar gives good contrast as his hot-shot contender for top spot . \\nall in all , this movie is perhaps dated , yet in its hour and half can give a lot more entertainment than most of the contemporary movies . \\n',\n",

       "  b'the makers of spawn have created something almost as vacuous as this summer\\'s other comic book adaptation , batman and robin . \\nboth films make the mistake of adapting for the screen not only the look of their graphic counterparts , but also their monosyllabic dialogue and empty-headed character motivations . \\nin panel-sized morsels , implausible plots and \" rambo \" -esque dialogue are often overshadowed by the artwork , but on thirty foot silver screens , it\\'s much more difficult to dismiss the shallowness behind the pretty pictures . \\nspawn is ostensibly about an assassin named simmons ( white ) who is framed by a corporate baddie ( played without irony by sheen ) , then set on fire and left for dead . \\nthough the movie skimps on the next few plot points , here\\'s what i could determine : said assassin then becomes the leader of satan\\'s army , under the tutelage of a flatulating midget named clown ( leguizamo , grating as always ) . \\nhe is renamed , for reasons unbeknownst , spawn , and granted a really cool costume that enables him to become something of a human chameleon . \\nbut when spawn spies on a birthday party for his child , he realizes that he can\\'t be the evil superdemon he\\'s expected to be , and he sets about avenging his untimely death . \\ntypical of summer blockbusters , spawn is an effects-laden ninety minute rock video . \\nwhile the visions of hell are laughably crude ( think the virtual reality sequences of the lawnmower man ) , spawn\\'s prehensile outfit and the action sequences are truly something to behold . \\nbut the storytelling is completely lacking in emotion ( spawn longs for his wife , but they don\\'t have a single scene together before simmons\\' death ! ) , conflict ( who will triumph is not anybody\\'s guess ) , and believability ( not that i expected it ) . \\nso many questions are left unanswered , and i\\'m sure they won\\'t be addressed in the inevitable sequel . \\nwhile last year\\'s the crow : city of angels suffered similar problems with its narrative ( which was lazy and somewhat incoherent ) , it had atmosphere to spare and genuine moments of hypnotic power . \\nspawn is an in-your-face , screaming banshee of a film ; these guys know how to graft a comic book onto celluloid , but they haven\\'t the faintest idea how to make a movie . \\n',\n",
       "  b'all feature film directors who cut their teeth on music videos , please raise your hands . \\nthank you for identifying yourselves ; now would you all please go away . \\nyour influence has to rank as one of the most annoying trends in filmmaking in the last decade , and it shows no sign of abating any time soon . \\nit isn\\'t just the strobe light quality of your twenty-cuts-per-minute editing , or the numbing over-use of popular music artists on the soundtracks which makes me suspicious of any film advertised \" featuring the music of . . . \" no , it is a kind of cynicism you have perfected , banking on the idea that no one will care about the lack of a story if you include enough bells and whistles . \\nwelcome to the club , scott kalvert . \\nyour adaptation of the basketball diaries is loud and one-dimensional , serving only as the vehicle for a performance by leonardo dicaprio that is better in pieces than it is as a whole . \\ndicaprio stars as jim carroll , the new york poet/songwriter/ performer on whose autobiographical writings the film is based . \\nas the film opens , jim is a budding high school basketball star given to petty thievery and getting drunk with buddies mickey ( mark wahlberg ) , pedro ( james madio ) and neutron ( patrick mcgaw ) . \\none night , jim graduates from inhalants to cocaine , and shortly thereafter to heroin . \\njim\\'s addiction to the drug starts him on a downhill spiral , as he is kicked off the basketball team by his coach ( bruno kirby ) , kicked out of his home by his mother ( lorraine bracco ) , and drops out of school . \\nalong with mickey and pedro , jim becomes a victim of the street , living from fix to fix and sinking lower and lower . \\nthe basketball diaries has been bouncing around as a project for years , but the sticking point has always been that jim carroll as a character was too unsympathetic and too much a loner . \\nscreenwriter bryan goluboff created the three characters who act as carroll\\'s posse , resulting in a jim carroll who is just as unsympathetic , but now with equally unsympathetic friends . \\nas a film , the basketball diaries may be intended primarily as a cautionary tale , a 100 minute long \" just say no \" public service announcement , but as drama it is monumentally ineffective because it is impossible to care much about anyone in the movie . \\njim is sort of a jerk even before he becomes a junkie , but i suppose that his pseudo-sensitive poetry and his devotion to his terminally ill friend are intended to balance that out . \\nperhaps we are expected to see jim as one of those \" good kids who falls in with the wrong crowd \" that every parent believes his or her troubled child to be ; i saw him simply as part of the bad crowd . \\nwithout a character who changes in any appreciable way , the basketball diaries rapidly degenerates into a collection of crimes committed by jim and his strung-out cohorts , all choreographed to an oppressively loud soundtrack . \\ndirector scott kalvert doesn\\'t have many scenes with intrinsic dramatic impact with which to work , so he substitutes silly slow-motion photography , self-consciously funky camera angles and choppy editing . \\non only one occasion , when a steady pan around a room where jim is trying to detox makes it appear that the walls are closing in , are any of the gimmicks effective . \\nmostly , they just draw attention to how hollow the story is . \\nthey also don\\'t allow leonardo dicaprio\\'s performance to be as strong as it could have been . \\nfor every impressive moment , like his desperate attempt to get his mother to give him money , there is a scene where kalvert pulls too much of the focus to his own camera theatrics . \\ndicaprio is most effective when he is playing off other actors , particularly a fine sequence featuring ernie hudson as an ex-junkie who tries to help jim straighten out , but kalvert won\\'t let character interaction define this story . \\nhe wants to turn dicaprio into a rock star , shooting him in dramatic fashion but denying him the opportunity to do much acting . \\nat isolate moments , the basketball diaries is a fine showcase for dicaprio\\'s talents . \\nfar more frequently , it looks like kalvert is trying to imagine what a long form velvet underground video might have looked like . \\n',\n",
       "  b'sometimes i find 19th century british costume dramas a little hard to relate to . \\nit\\'s not the time or the distance , it\\'s the rules and conventions of a social class that deserves resentment rather than sympathy . \\nyet somehow , the movies are all well made and i always get caught up in the story . \\nthe wings of the dove fits the pattern . \\nkate ( helena bonham carter ) and merton ( linus roache ) are in love . \\nmerton , a newspaper writer , would like to marry kate . \\nbut kate\\'s \" job \" , if you will , is to be a member of the british upper class . \\nher father lost all of her family\\'s money , but a wealthy aunt agreed to take care of her until she married a nice rich man . \\nnaturally , a newspaper writer\\'s wages don\\'t count as \" rich . \" \\nkate leads him on , but she always ends up giving him the cold shoulder , ultimately because he\\'s not marriageable . \\nkate\\'s american friend millie ( alison elliot ) stops in for a visit on her way to venice . \\nat a party , millie catches a glimpse of merton and likes what she sees . \\nkate realizes that if merton were introduced to millie , he might forget about her . \\nit appears that she is trying to spare him from the heartbreak of their inevitable breakup . \\nmerton sees what kate is doing and resents her for it . \\nhe is still in love with kate , and will accept no substitute . \\nthe three of them , along with a fourth friend ( elizabeth mcgovern ) end up on holiday in venice together , where their interactions are quite complicated . \\nlet\\'s sum up : millie has fallen for merton . \\nmerton has no feelings for millie because he is still in love with kate . \\nkate loves him but can\\'t marry him , so on the one hand she\\'s trying to match him up with someone who will make him happy , but on the other hand she\\'s jealous of them as a couple . \\na clear solution presents itself to kate when she realizes that millie is very sick - dying , in fact . \\nat this point she decides that merton should marry millie until she dies . \\nmillie will leave her money to merton , who will then be rich enough to marry kate . \\nshe lets merton know of her schemes and , since it will help him win kate , he reluctantly agrees . \\nkate leaves venice so that the two m\\'s can be alone together . \\nmerton finds that pretending to love millie is a lot like actually loving her . \\nhe\\'s not sure he can separate the two . \\nkate finds that she\\'s not so sure she really wants her merton falling in love with and marrying anyone else . \\nthe brilliant scheme proves to be painful to all involved . \\nwithout revealing the details , suffice it to say that the situation ends badly . \\nthe title refers to the object of merton\\'s vain hope that something might lift him from his predicament . \\none is left with feelings of regret and despair . \\nwhat started as such a promising relationship was damaged by greed , anger , and jealousy . \\nan interesting thought struck me after the movie was over , and that is that the wings of the dove almost fits the story line of a film noir . \\na couple conspires to cheat someone out of their money so they can live happily ever after . \\ntheir involvement in the deception makes each less attractive to the other , and after a few things go wrong , the whole idea seems like an awful life-ruining mistake . \\ni wouldn\\'t call the wings of the dove a film noir , but the comparison is interesting . \\nas i have acknowledged before , i am not a wonderful judge of acting , but i liked the performances from roache and elliot . \\nroache successfully conveyed his character\\'s ambivalence toward millie : near the end , he hugs her , at first staring into space , as if he\\'s thinking about his plan with kate , then giving that up to fully embrace millie . \\nmillie\\'s part didn\\'t require as much range , but elliot gave her the necessary bubbly personality that made her irresistible . \\ni will probably file away the wings of the dove in the same low-traffic corner of my mind as sense and sensibility and persuasion . \\ntheir settings are far removed from my personal experience - geographically , historically , and socially . \\nstill , the movies are well made and the stories inevitably win me over . \\n',\n",
       "  b'synopsis : melissa , a mentally-disturbed woman who likes to smoke , seduces doug , a minor-league baseball player who likes to study anatomy , work on motorcycles , and make out with his girlfriend in a public library . \\nwhen doug decides to stop seeing her , melissa maliciously takes revenge on those around him , including his girlfriend , his mother , and his cat . \\ncomments : malicious , i suppose , is an acceptable moview for what it is : a cheap , b-movie thriller which rips off dozens and dozens of spurned-psycho-lover-who-wants-revenge films ( like fatal attraction , hand that rocks the cradle , etc . etc . ) that have come before it . \\nmalicious , however , really doesn\\'t provide very many particularly suspenseful moments . \\nthe plot starts off energetically enough , the main characters are introduced and the affair between doug and melissa begins and ends pretty early on in the film . \\nit starts to drag , unfortunately , after this . \\nmelissa will obviously try to take her revenge on doug ( as always seems to happen in movies like these ) , but she does so in unimaginative ways that have been done in other , better thrillers before . \\nshe drugs someone . \\nshe kills a family pet and leaves it in the girlfriend\\'s apartment . \\nand , of course , she stalks , so we see a number of shots , which are supposed to be suspenseful , where she\\'s spying on doug and his girlfriend . \\ni won\\'t reveal the ludicrous ending to this turkey , but i warn you that it\\'s both painfully obvious and a real yawner . \\njohn vernon does a remarkably good job at playing the not-so-bright baseball jock who initially gets swept away by melissa ( one of the script\\'s faults is to try to pass off a character like this as a pre-med student ) . \\nthe same cannot be said , though , for molly ringwald . \\nat times , she can effectively pull off the obsessed lover routine , especially during her silent , i\\'m-going-to-stare-you-down scenes . \\nat other times , however , she just seems somehow goofy and out of place . \\nin one particular scene which i guess was supposed to be suspenseful , she screeches \" f--k you , you b-----d \" and throws a phone . \\nshe delivers the line so ridiculously that one can\\'t help but laugh . \\nmalicious certainly isn\\'t the worst thriller of its kind out in the video racks ( a number of really fat turkies in this genre are out there ) , but it isn\\'t all that good or original either . \\nfeel free to treat this film maliciously , watch something else . \\n',\n",
       "  b\"one of the biggest cliches of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable . \\nyou know , the one where the detective looks at a wall of pictures and other police information , and suddenly spots the clue which reveals who the killer is . \\nsure , it's been used over and over , but for some reason , it is always fun to watch . \\nthis cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girls works on : overused , but always fun . \\none of my personal rules about watching a film is not how original the film is , but how it goes around giving its story . \\nthis rule applies highly to kiss the girls . \\nthere is something psychologically stimulating in a well-crafted serial killer movie , and kiss the girls is certainly well made . \\nhowever , the whole film screams of unoriginality , and so it relies on the power of its actors and the technical detail to pull it through . \\nwell , not only are the actors capable of pulling it through , but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up . \\nunfortunately , one of the most revealing and rather insulting choices by the filmmakers ( one that seven , a film a lot like this one , knew not to make ) was to put the name of the killer in the opening credits . \\nthat may give the actor credit for the role , but throughout the film , hidden in my mind , i was waiting for him to appear on screen , which spoiled the mystery . \\nhowever , credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most of the film . \\nplotwise , kiss the girls shows almost no originality . \\nwe are introduced to detective alex cross ( morgan freeman ) , a forensic psychologist , and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him as the hero . \\nhe gets a call about a woman who has shot her husband and is now threatening to kill herself . \\nobviously cross succeeds at getting the gun , but this scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene . \\nat his house , cross is told that his neice , naomi ( gina ravera ) , has been missing for four days . \\nthis provides the motivation for cross to find the killer , but we are never given a chance to establish the relationship between the two , and as a result , we can't sympathize with detective cross . \\nhowever , what makes kiss the girls slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees . . . \\nbefore she is abducted . \\ndr . kate mctiernan ( ashley judd , the actress of the judd family ) is a smart , athletic woman , and because of these traits , becomes a target for casanova--what the serial killer likes to call himself . \\nbecause of these character-developing scenes , we care for mctiernan , making the abduction scene all that more suspenseful . \\nafter being abducted , mctiernan wakes up and finds herself in a cell somewhere in the woods . \\nremembering that the killer gave her certain rules , she decides to break one of them by calling out . \\nwhen casanova comes to punish her , she breaks out and escapes by jumping over a waterfall . \\nafter she is found , she begins to help cross find his neice . \\nfrom this moment on , kiss the girls takes on the form of every other serial killer film , as the two leads search for the rest of the victims held captive . \\nmany people will compare this film to 1995's seven , another killer film starring morgan freeman , but i presume that the similarities are intentional . \\nthe screenplay , by david klass , is adapted from the novel written by james patterson , and yet i don't quite see how this story could have worked in novel form . \\nwhat makes kiss the girls so good is the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness . \\nthe cinematography , by aaron schneider , is reminiscient of seven , and sometimes i felt that many of the shots were trying too hard to impress us . \\nsometimes a simple shot is the best one . \\nhowever , many of the shots are stunning , and unlike seven , most of them take place during the day , in sunlight . \\nthe scene when ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done , in more than one way . \\nthe camera work is terrific , but the editing makes this scene work so well . \\nthe chaotic and mtv-type cutting gives the audience a sense of confusion and unawareness , exactly what judd's character is experiencing . \\nhowever , the best aspect of kiss the girls is its actors . \\nmorgan freeman is one of today's most powerful and believable actors . \\ndetective cross is a very good character for him , although it is just a similar one to the character in seven . \\nbecause of freeman's powerful presence , he carries half the film by himself . \\nthe other half is carried by ashley judd , one of today's most promising dramatic actresses . \\nin fact , her performance is better than freeman's , if that is even possible . \\nher character is more original than freeman's , and she handles it wonderfully . \\nwe finally have a female character in a movie like this who does more than just scream . \\nthe supporting cast is highly underdeveloped , but the cast members do as much as they can with it . \\ncary elwes portrays a cop in north carolina , and unfortunately has scraps for a character . \\ntony goldwyn fairs slightly better , but we don't really get to know his character either . \\ngina ravera gives a good performance , but again she isn't in many of the scenes . \\nso as a result of all these small supporting parts , the weight of the film lies on the two leads , and they do a phenomenal job . \\nsome of the best acting of this genre , and some of the best acting of the year . \\ntwo other essential aspects of the film are quite good . \\ndirector gary fleder does a good job of controlling his actors , but the second half of the film loses believability , especially during the revelation of the killer . \\nhe also doesn't handle the suspenseful scenes as a better director would have , losing a lot of tension during many scenes . \\nhowever , to his credit , he does manage a terrific first half . \\npart of the blame falls on david klass . \\ni'm sure the book developed many of the lesser characters more , but klass focuses on the two main parts . \\nwhile this may give the two leads more screentime , many of the small characters are one-dimensional , and the killer , when revealed , is extremely implausible . \\nthanks to the smart dialogue adapted from the novel , kiss the girls always seems intelligent . \\nnone of the conversations are laughable , and all move the plot forward without seeming forced . \\none of the biggest problems i had with the movie was the motive of the killer . \\ni blame this mainly on the casting director , because the killer's motive is because of rejection from women ( or so i assume from the opening monologue ) , but the killer himself is very attractive ( one of my friends is a , shall we say , big admirer of the killer ) . \\nkiss the girls is rated r for terror , violence , language , and suggested sex . \\nwith all the implausibilities of this film , and with the mediocre second half , kiss the girls somehow manages to thoroughly entertain . \\nin fact , i had the urge to see it again just for the performances . \\nthe cinematography adds a lot of mood to the already creepy tone , and the script is usually smart . \\nthis is clearly one of those movies which rely on the acting to pull it through . \\nmorgan freeman is possibly today's most convincing actor , and ashley judd adds another notch on her acting belt . \\ni must also say that i loved the ending . \\nthe showdown between good and evil was quite tense , and the resolution of the scene makes almost anyone cheer . \\nperhaps it may not

       "  b'it seemed like the perfect concept . \\nwhat better for the farrelly brothers , famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter , than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality ? \\nit\\'s exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish : poking fun at something serious ( in this case mental illness ) , throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh . \\njim carrey\\'s signed on too ? \\neven better . \\nthe national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers\\' new film before its opening , claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality , labeling it incorrectly as \" schizophrenia , \" and so forth . \\nsuch a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would , of course , only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers\\' fire , proving that some people just couldn\\'t take a joke , and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy . \\nyes , it all seemed perfect , but one thing went wrong : their movie isn\\'t funny . \\nit\\'s not for lack of trying . \\nthe farrellys utilize in \" me , myself & irene \" their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them . \\nthis , of course , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature , making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult . \\nsoon enough , charlie\\'s repressed aggression manifests itself into a second , independent personality named hank , a deep-voiced , boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster . \\nthis guy isn\\'t above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he\\'s been insulted , or holding a little girl\\'s head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street . \\nthen things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted , and the film runs off its tracks . \\nsome have suggested that this isn\\'t a problem , because the farrelly brothers\\' brand of humor doesn\\'t require plot to work . \\nthey\\'re wrong , of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys\\' last effort , 1996\\'s \" there\\'s something about mary . \" \\n ( 1999\\'s \" outside providence \" was technically an earlier project . ) \\nthe brothers\\' earlier film wasn\\'t funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe ) , but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected . \\nin \" mary , \" the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick : they\\'d have you thinking the story was going one way , then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion . \\n \" me , myself & irene , \" by contrast , seems to have been made by folks who looked at \" mary \" and saw only the surface grossness , missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work . \\nhaving been produced by the same guys who made \" mary , \" \" irene \" seems like an even bigger disappointment . \\nthe brothers pile on the offensive humor , taking shots at race , midgets , albinos , mental illness , and all manner of bathroom jokes . \\nbut they haven\\'t come up with a way to make any of it fresh most of \" me , myself & irene \" comes off as rote , by-the-numbers , adolescent comedy . \\nthe plot , with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p . waters ( renee zellweger ) , who\\'s in more trouble than anyone knows , back to new york , has an ending that\\'s entirely predictable from the get-go . \\n ( think charlie and irene will fall in love ? \\nyeah , me too . ) \\nthe farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven\\'t already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be . \\ncompared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value , it\\'s no longer funny , merely gross . \\nthe jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry . \\ntake , for example , the subplot involving charlie\\'s three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon ) . \\nthe incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face . \\nbut by the end of the film , they\\'re still doing the same schitck it hasn\\'t been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn\\'t been dropped either . \\nthat\\'s too bad , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through . \\n \" me , myself & irene \" reeks of wasted opportunities . \\nthere ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie\\'s new personality , and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank\\'s actions . \\nthis doesn\\'t really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlie\\'s condition early on , so they don\\'t have any opportunity to be surprised by it . \\nthe film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called , appropriately , \" whitey \" ) , but the script doesn\\'t go anywhere with it , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax . \\njim carrey is a gifted comedian , both physically and vocally , but he\\'s left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in \" all of me . \" \\nit\\'s a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting , but none of it is terribly funny . \\ncarrey doesn\\'t pull any stunts we don\\'t expect him to pull , and the farrellys\\' script doesn\\'t give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role-shifting aren\\'t set up in any meaningful way . \\nperhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better . \\nzellweger\\'s irene is not a strong female lead mary in \" mary \" may have been part adolescent fantasy , but she was also intelligent and strong-willed . \\nirene is nothing in particular , as the film never makes clear whether she\\'s ditzy , clever , or neither . \\nas such , she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only \" sane \" person in the film . \\nchris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent , and his character is entirely too straight-laced for a movie like this . \\nhe , like the others , does absolutely nothing unexpected . \\nafter viewing the shapeless mess that \" me , myself & irene \" eventually dissolved into , i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves . \\nmaybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked . \\nbut i don\\'t believe it -- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style . \\nif the farrellys are indeed good , smart filmmakers ( and i still think they are ) , they\\'ll rebound just fine . \\neven after that happens , though , i\\'ll still consider \" me , myself & irene \" to be a high-caliber misfire . \\n',\n",

\\nwill everyone in the town turn against the coach ? \\nwill the team win the climactic game ? \\ndo cats bathe themselves regularly ? \\nthe so-called \" hero \" in question is john moxin ( james van der beek ) , a senior at west canaan high school who plays for the varsity football team , but is really just hoping to get a scholarship at brown university so that he can get out of the dead-end town . \\nat least he\\'s got the right idea , since west canaan , texas is portrayed in the film as , frankly , pathetic , with the whole town treating the weekly football games as the second coming . \\nheck , in one scene , the front page of the town\\'s newspaper is proclaiming about the west canaan badgers\\' big win the night before . \\nwhen the team\\'s star quarterback is severely injured , tearing the ligaments in his leg , john finds himself taking over as the team\\'s leader , but his few minutes of glory do not last long , as he begins to have problems with his girlfriend ( amy smart ) when she discovers he spent an evening with another girl ( ali larter ) . \\nand after staying out all night with his drinking buddies at a strip joint ( all of the teenagers in the film are portrayed as raging alcoholics ) , the team loses their second-to-last game , putting john at feuds with the coach ( jon voight who , like gary oldman , is overstaying his welcome in the typecasted role as the \" bad guy \" ) . \\nworse yet , the coach is threatening to ruin john\\'s scholarship chances if the badgers don\\'t win their final game . \\nthe plotting of \" varsity blues \" is as old as the hills , and contains every cliche in the book . \\nadmittedly , i was never exactly bored while i was watching it , but i hasten to add that i was rarely ever entertained . \\nthroughout , all i could really think of is how virtually the same exact story had been filmed with a great deal more thoughtfulness and maturity in 1983\\'s \" all the right moves . \" \\none of the biggest problems i had with the film is how little of interest any of the characters actually were , least of all certainly not john , who , played by van der beek ( of tv\\'s \" dawson\\'s creek \" ) , is pretty much a bore without any engaging qualities . \\nwhile i probably shouldn\\'t blame this on van der beek , since the inauspicious and \" by-the-numbers \" screenplay by w . peter iliff isn\\'t of any help , he is still certainly not in the league of tom cruise in \" all the right moves . \" \\nthe story revolving around john , meanwhile , is extemely thin throughout , particularly for its 104-minute running time , and it alternates between uninspired comic relief ( as in when the students see their sex education teacher working as a stripper at the club ) and heavy-handed melodrama . \\nthe romance between john and his girlfriend had the potential to be an adequate subplot , but we also learned very little about her , which is unfortunate since amy smart , whom i don\\'t think i\\'ve seen before in past films , is probably the only character written with any sort of intelligence . \\nsmart does not allow her character to become the \" passive girlfriend , \" instead coming off as a young woman with her own ideas and opinions . \\nit\\'s too bad the camera didn\\'t linger on her long enough so we could hear some of those thoughts . \\nthe adult characters probably fare the worse of any , since they all must play residents of a dim-witted town that cares about nothing but football . \\njohn\\'s relationship with his parents can also be telegraphed far in advance . \\nhis father is set on him becoming a football player at a university , but john doesn\\'t want any part of that . \\nhis mother stands beside her \" big , strong husband \" and is a passive female . \\nfinally , jon voight plays the stock bully coach character and he does nothing to make the thankless role any more than one-dimensional . \\nsaving \" varsity blues \" from being a total washout are a few amusing sequences , including one set in the sex education class , which did get a laugh out of me . \\nthe scenes of playing football were well-shot and thankfully didn\\'t overstay their welcome , as many sports films fall victim to . \\nbut leaving the theater , the question i had in my mind was why did this film need to be made ? \\ni seem to be asking this question quite a lot lately , since the same old stories seem to be cranking out of hollywood . \\ndo we really need another high-school sports film ? \\nno , we don\\'t , and certainly not one of this low-caliber , which felt like a cut-and-paste job of spare parts from much better , but similar , films . \\n \" varsity blues , \" no doubt is the first one , however , to include an earnest scene in which one of the characters is only wearing whipped cream on their private parts . \\n',\n",
       "  b'not since attending an ingmar bergman retrospective a few years ago have i seen a film as uncompromising in its portrayal of emotional truth as secrets & lies . \\nlike bergman , director mike leigh is interested in probing his characters\\' inner depths through hypernaturally blunt confrontations . \\nalso like bergman , leigh engages in frequent closeups of his characters\\' ravished and wracked faces . \\nand the prominent mournfulness of a cello on the soundtrack recalls bergman\\'s own use of a bach cello suite in an earlier film . \\nall that is missing is a discussion of god . \\nwhich is not to say that secrets & lies is nothing more than an homage to the swedish master . \\nin fact , it is quite possible leigh had no such intentions in mind . \\nnonetheless , what we get is so far removed from the average moviegoing experience -- even from the reason we go to the movies in the first place -- that it takes some effort to adjust to the film\\'s rhythms . \\nonce the adjustment is made , however , there are great rewards . \\none such is the chance to see life on the screen as it really is . \\nthough leigh may have adopted some of bergman\\'s stylistic touches , most obviously in an early scene of terse cross-cutting during a married couple\\'s strained conversation , as well as in that somewhat obtrusive score , the overall feeling of the film is that it eschews any \" style \" at all . \\nwhereas bergman uses artifice as a tool to expose reality , leigh makes the camera a mere observer , almost as in a pbs documentary . \\nthe effect of this is to focus all of your attention on the actors . \\nit is a tribute to everyone involved that , despite such scrutiny , only infrequently are we aware that anyone * is * acting . \\nmuch has been made of brenda blethyn\\'s performance , and rightly so , but it is only when you remind yourself that you are watching a fiction that you realize how good she is . \\nthere are a few missteps . \\nfor one , except for one scene ( tragicomic , as it happens ) , there is scant humor in the film . \\nthis leads to a certain monotonous tone throughout . \\nand occasionally ( as with bergman ) the bluntness of the situations can seem forced . \\nfor all that , this longish film manages to keep hold of your attention . \\nit is unfortunate that the audience for secrets & lies will most likely be limited to an intellectual elite , for there is nothing inherently intellectual about this film . \\nin fact , it might easily resonate more strongly for millions of working class filmgoers who will likely never see it . \\nthere is even a sweet but significant irony in the film\\'s unspoken take on race relations , something an american audience at least would do well to observe . \\nnonetheless , secrets & lies is not for the faint of heart . \\nthough there is nothing physically horrific to make one squeamish , the exploration of common human frailty can be so raw and unsparing that it is tempting to turn from the screen . \\nneedless to say , it is also very depressing at times . \\nbut for many of us , of course , so is life . \\nand though the film is too honest to tack on a phony happy ending , that same honesty allows it to admit that things can also get better . \\n',\n",

) in the hospital . \\ntensions mount and distrust build among the rest as they watch their chance for the bonus start to slip away . \\nbut , there is more , much more , at stake as the hospital and its history of insanity weigh on them all . \\ni don\\'t want to give away too much of the story of \" session 9 , \" so i\\'ll stop there . \\nwhat we have here is a spooky horror flick that uses none of the jump-out-at-you-from-the-dark cheap shots that have become part and parcel with horror films since the advent of \" halloween \" and \" friday the thirteenth . \" \\nthere is no cat leaping out of the dark or the shock of suddenly seeing oneself in a strategically placed mirror . \\nwith the exception of one shadowy and chilling image at one point spooky interlude in the film , there is little that you can get your arms around as far as what , specifically , is \" frightening . \" \\nas i watched \" session 9 \" i became aware of the subtle things that built up during the story that make it a true horror movie . \\nthe striking high-definition video camera work by uta briesewitz ( who worked with the director , brad anderson , on his \" next stop wonderland \" ) helps to build up tension with close-ups , fluid camera movement and odd angles in a way that would make alfred hitchcock proud . \\nmusic , too , is used to intense effect , joining with the camera to make simple scenes frightening , even horrifying . \\ncouple these tech feats with an intelligent story that uses elements of \" the shining , \" \" the blair witch project \" and , even \" the texas chainsaw massacre \" and you get a decent , intriguing horror flick . \\nadditionally , the brilliant decision to shoot at danvers state hospital gives the film another starring character , the institution itself , which lends even more chills to the equation . \\nacting is another factor that raises \" session 9 \" above the usual dreck presented in recent horror hits like \" scream , \" \" i know what you did last summer \" and their sequels . \\nthose films took good-looking , though generic , young actors and actresses and put them to use to build up a body count , substituting mayhem for real horror . \\nanderson opted , instead , to use mature , experienced actors like peter mullan and david caruso to fill his characters\\' shoes and the difference in casting quality is notable . \\nmullan , in particular , puts an arc on his character , gordon , as the troubled guy who slowly and inexorably falls under the pressures of family , job and , finally , danvers state hospital . \\nthe rest of the small cast fit the bill as people , not just fodder for the mayhem . \\ndavid caruso , as gordo\\'s senior man and near equal in the business , shows just how good an actor he is . \\nhe made the jump from tv\\'s \" nypd blue \" to film far too soon and his decisions in the roles he took ( i\\'ll never forget the horrendous \" jade \" ) were less than star making . \\nhe rolls his sleeves up and does the job well here . \\ngevedon , lucas and sexton are more than fodder , too . \\nthe only problem with \" session 9 \" lay in the uninspired ending . \\nit takes on a fairly conventional finale that covers old ground and is a bit of a disappointment after the terrific ( and inspired ) build up . \\nthe pleasure is getting there and i wish that anderson and gevedon had kept up the steam they had so ably built during the bulk of the film \\n \" session 9 \" is an unusual feat . \\nit is scary , doesn\\'t use cheap tricks and raises goose bumps with its intelligently rendered , subtle horror . \\nbecause of the local interest of danvers , it should do well with the northeast crowd . \\ni hope it gets the national distribution it deserves . \\ni give it a b+ . \\n',\n",

       "  b'available in an all new video edition from arrow entertainment ( $29 . 95 ) , with an introduction by david carradine , written & produced by wayne j . keeley \\nf . w . murnau\\'s career ended sadly and prematurely . \\nthe german director of such classics as \" sunrise \" and \" the last laugh \" died in a car accident shortly after signing a deal to make american pictures at paramount . \\nmurnau was reportedly a giant man , well over six feet , a towering figure probably incapable of anything but a grand entrance . \\nwhich brings us to \" nosferatu : a symphony of horror \" : surely he felt a kinship with his title character , the looming vampire embodied by intimidating max schreck ; in one of the most indelible images in film history , silent or otherwise , schreck rises from his grave , gnarled hands outstretched , and he\\'s so big that part of his head is cropped by the top of the frame . \\nthe plot of \" nosferatu . . . \" \\nis lifted--unauthorized--from bram stoker\\'s \" dracula \" . \\nthe british hutter is an eager real estate man assigned to visit and discuss future living arrangements with count orlock of transylvania . \\nhe leaves behind girlfriend emily , only to discover orlock\\'s secret--he\\'s a bloodsucker--and struggle to return to england before the nosferatu reaches his lady love . \\nin addition to schreck\\'s performance , the cinematography and effects are outstanding . \\narrow video\\'s digitally remastered version of the classic is something of a mixed-coffin . \\nthe cover art features a red-tinted , hairy , goateed vampire staring straight at you , his fanged mouth agape , while the bodies of two sexy , writhing women entice you below . \\ntrouble is , murnau\\'s monster is pale-faced , bald , pointy-eared , and non-goateed , and there isn\\'t a single sexy , writhing woman to be found in his movie . \\nthis sort of misleading packaging makes little sense when one recalls the countless number of ghouslish scenes in the film from which cool cover art could have been extracted . \\nadditionally , notifying the viewer that this is in fact murnau\\'s film seems like afterthought since his name and the genuine title are written in small print below our goateed vampire . \\nthat said , a good mastering job has been performed on the film itself . \\nthe original elements are not in the best condition--non-studio silents were unlucky in their preservation-- so we\\'re still dealing with a slightly washed out , scratched , jittering image . \\nbut at least the day and night scenes are tinted sepia and blue , respectively , especially helpful to an audience who may question nosferatu\\'s waltzing around during what seems like sunlight ( it took a lot of light to expose stock in the twenties ) . \\nthe title cards have been redone , and they are legible , accurate , and digitally altered to flicker--a very nice touch . \\n ( even the opening copyright warning flickers ! ) \\nthe score has been replaced by music from type o negative , a hard-rock group , arguably gothic , and their songs underscore the film nicely-- certainly the coolest video a band can ask for . \\nwhen our hero , hutter , first steps onto the doomed carriage to count orlock\\'s castle , we hear a well-timed \" now you\\'re dead ! \" \\nfrom lead singer peter steele . \\ndavid carradine makes an appropriately vampiric host ; he fiddles with a blade and cane while introducing the film . \\nafter the feature , which runs about 63 minutes , is included a new music video from type o negative , the black-and-white fang-fest \" black no . 1 \" . \\nof course , \" nosferatu : a symphony of horror \" is the main attraction , and while my latest viewing raised questions ( why is the woman called emily in the title cards but \" mina \" --as bram stoker called her--in hutter\\'s letters ? , for instance ) , it made me realize how much this movie has inspired and been stolen from . \\ncoppola\\'s 1992 \" bram stoker\\'s dracula \" owes a great stylistic debt to murnau\\'s masterpiece , but the one thing it couldn\\'t thieve was the original\\'s abstract charms . \\nthis latest incarnation from arrow will probably- -like the rescored \" metropolis \" a few years back--turn a silent film into more palpable entertainment for the latest generation of film freaks . \\n',\n",
       "  b'the disney studios has its formula for annual , full-length animated features down so pat that it\\'s hard to remember which one you\\'re watching at any given moment . \\n \" mulan , \" their 36th animated adventure , is the latest case in point . \\nonce again we have a tale focused around a strong central character ( female as usual ; disney is one of the few studios whose heroines--ariel , belle , pocahontas , and now mulan--get equal screen time with their heroes in recent years ) . \\nadd the requisite love interest and a wise-cracking sidekick or two , pep up the soundtrack with a handful of strategically placed show tunes ( an introspective number by a pool or looking in a mirror , a rousing anthem , a cutesy , montage-backed crowd pleaser ) , pose a few threats to our engaging lead , and tie things all up neatly by the closing credits . \\nbob\\'s your uncle ! \\nbetter make that walt\\'s your uncle . . . \\nkids will no doubt go ga-ga over \" mulan \" ( or at least the fast food tie-ins ) , but familiarity can , after a while , leave grown-ups--this reviewer included--wishing for a little more . \\nmaybe an animated feature without--shock ! \\nhorror ! --the \\nsongs , for example ? \\nor maybe a film in which a cheeky chihuahua called pepe longs to become a matador from trinidad ? ? \\nhow about simply ditching the sidekicks altogether ? \\nit isn\\'t gonna happen . \\nlike disney\\'s previous entries , \" mulan \" is slow to make its mark . \\nthe animation tends to suffer from some slackness in the early going and the humorous element , a madcap dragon wannabe ( in the guise of a loquacious lizard with a case of dry mouth , courtesy eddie murphy\\'s animated vocal talents ) , plays like an inappropriate if necessary ( formula-wise ) afterthought . \\nhowever , after about an hour everything comes together and the formula , like it or not , clicks . \\nhighlights include a spectacular cavalry charge on a snow-covered pass ( which , due to the sophistication of today\\'s computer-generated imagery , is hard to tell from the real thing ) , a memorable , show-stopping musical interlude ( \" i\\'ll make a man out of you , \" penned by matthew wilder and david zippel ) , and last but not least , mulan herself . \\nvoiced by ming-na wen , mulan is disney\\'s strongest female character to date . \\nwhen hordes of huns pour over china\\'s great wall and threaten to overthrow the imperial palace , the emperor decrees that every family in the land dispatch one man to serve in the imperial army . \\nsince mulan\\'s father is infirm , but proud , the high-spirited mulan steals her father\\'s armor and , incognito , signs up to face the mongolian menace . \\nattracted to , but not distracted by , her commanding officer shang ( b . d . \\nwong ) , mulan outmatches her fellow combatants in smarts , wit , and physical ability . \\nshe\\'s a woman of the \\'90s a couple of millennia ahead of her time . \\n',\n",
       "  b'it stands as a moment one will not soon forget : a giant , green ogre flips through the pages of a cliche fairy tale , narrating it with every bit of dull inspiration that the story holds . \\nthis leads one to believe that this serves as the prologue to shrek , dreamworks\\' second computer animated feature , but in a pricelessly hilarious bit of cinema , a page of this tale serves as that ogre\\'s toilet paper . \\nfrom this opening moment , one can infer shrek\\'s defying of all expectations regarding it as a standard , disney-esque fairy tale . \\nalthough rampant moments of hilarity dot shrek , the true charm of the film lies in the bold elements of friendship , courage , and acceptance , excelled by outstanding direction , stunning actor voice work , and most importantly , a witty screenplay with more going on than meets the eye . \\nwhile shrek features an abundance of humor related directly toward adults , positive friendship values aimed at younger children fulfill the storyline : shrek , the previously mentioned ogre , holds a position of absolute nothingness within his community . \\nthe jolly green giant meets a fellow outsider , known only as the donkey ( his species ) who talks , and although he remains reluctant to warm up to him for a good portion of time , shrek eventually comes to a mutual understanding with him by acknowledging their common state as outcasts of the world . \\nthe pair team up to retrieve princess fiona from a castle guarded by a dragon for the powerful lord farquaad , learning quite a bit about each other and themselves along the way . \\ntheir friendship exhibits the core theme of the need for someone to lean on , exemplifying to any child who may witness the film that acting as an honest companion can unquestionably affect someone . \\nshrek and donkey endure as supposed freaks of nature due only to their differences from others but cling to each other for support and guidance along their journey . \\ncourage demonstrates itself within two major storylines : along the journey to rescue fiona , donkey\\'s immeasurable cowardice reveals itself . \\nwhether he encounters walking over a shaky bridge or living alone , donkey withholds fears that he continuously puts aside without self-acknowledgment . \\nbut the yapping donkey must face his phobias when presented with the giant , fire-breathing dragon guarding fiona ; either he dies from terror or he triumphs with courage . \\nhe wisely chooses courage by pretending as if no dangerous situation actually faces him , allowing the donkey to overcome a horror that likely only continued due to his insistence of them . \\nsecondly , upon shrek\\'s and donkey\\'s redeeming of princess fiona , the ogre finds the princess has plans for whomever saves her : to satisfy her desire for a ( human ) knight in shining armor . \\nthroughout this storyline , shrek faces his deep , perpetual misgivings of inhering as an ogre and struggles to determine how he will reveal his true identity to fiona . \\nan ongoing struggle occurs between himself and his reluctance of the truth , but eventually , shrek courageously conquers his fear by telling the forbidden secret to fiona . \\nchildren can realize from donkey and shrek that fear remains only as complicated as one makes it ; if one sets his/her mind to overcoming something in particular , endless possibilities exist . \\nafter the friendships and courage prevail , the three central characters at the heart of shrek must take one more stretch of development : acceptance . \\nsurprisingly , fiona holds a dark secret of her own : due to a spell cast upon her years ago , she transforms into an ogre by night . \\nin this storyline , fiona must learn to hold acceptance for herself , and she must realize what beauty truly means : to simply act as one\\'s self . \\nupon fiona\\'s learning of shrek\\'s desire to pursue a relationship with her , fiona , knowing that acceptance of herself serves as the only platform for her love with shrek to work , gives in to her inner demons of self-ridicule and hatred . \\nany child can pull from fiona\\'s transformation the meaning of beauty and the meaning of self-acceptance . \\non the technical side , shrek triumphs . \\ndirectors adam adamson and vicky jenson pace shrek in a consistent and satisfying manner , evenly distributing the lessons learned by the central characters . \\nthese central characters spring to life thanks to brilliant voice work from mike myers ( shrek ) , eddie murphy ( donkey ) , and cameron diaz ( princess fiona ) . \\nmyers creates his shrek as a lovable and troubled ogre whose green color not only serves as a skin color but perhaps his envy of other , \" normal \" beings . \\nmurphy succeeds with his donkey through recreating the high-strung persona that so many know the actor to have off screen . \\ncameron diaz exudes charisma and innocence as fiona , giving the princess/ogre a sense of power that many female characters in animated films lack . \\nwhile the direction and voice work certainly elevate shrek , the ultimate factor in the film succeeding lies in the screenplay , written by ted elliott , terry rossio , joe stillman , and roger s . h . \\nschulman . \\nthe script never underestimates the intelligence of the viewer , combining the three previously spoken of elements with humor for adults and children alike . \\ncapping it off with a constant tongue-in-cheek feel that pokes fun at classic disney animated features , the fresh and entertaining screenplay delivers . \\nwith shrek , dreamworks executive jeffrey katzenberg has certainly one-upped himself by creating an instant animated classic that will live on for ages to come . \\nthe smaller children will laugh and cheer ; the adults will laugh even harder and leave understanding much that their children did not . \\na film that breaks stereotypes and creates a definite standard of its own , shrek can certainly endure as one for the ages . \\n',\n",
       "  b' \" return to horror high , \" wants to be a couple different types of movies at once . \\nthe film tells the story of a low-budget horror movie being filmed at the closed-down crippen high , a school where a group of serial murders took place five years before . \\nbut what the cast and crew don\\'t know is that a real killer , maybe the same one that was never apprehended , is going into action again . \\non one level , \" return to horror high \" is a slasher movie , and it is at this level that it works the best on . \\nwatching the film , which was made in 1987 , i couldn\\'t help but take notice that the killer\\'s costume was almost identital to that of the ghostface in , \" scream , \" and \" scream 2 . \" \\non another level , the film wants to be a slapstick comedy , and there are many hints of this throughout . \\nunfortunately , most of these jokes fall flat . \\nand the last thing the film wants to be is a \" behind-the-scenes \" look at an exploitation film being made . \\nthe only problem is that , while much of it is supposed to be from the movie itself being made , no cameras are shown filming it , thus making it far more confusing than it had to be . \\nand to top it all off , the \" twist \" ending makes very little to no sense whatsoever , and so we are basically left with feeling as if we wasted our time . \\nthere are story developments that are beyond ludicrous , and plot holes you could drive a winnebago through . \\nif you see the film , or have seen it , you\\'ll know what i mean . \\nthe premise of \" return to horror high , \" is admittedly pretty crafty , and i liked the atmosphere of the school , which is where the whole thing takes place . \\nbut director froehlich , judging from this movie , is an incompetent director , except for being able to film the seldom suspeneful scene . \\nwell , come to think of it , there is only one scene that is actually scary , and it has to do with two actors being locked in a room as the killer tries to break in . \\nbut other than that two-minute distraction , \" return to horror high , \" is certainly no great shake . \\nnote : look for george clooney in a supporting role as one of the actors on the film . \\nand strangely enough , he is the first character to get the ax . . . literally . \\n',\n",

       "  b'when quentin tarantino made \" pulp fiction \" , he was not only making the greatest film of the 90s ; he was also making what i believe to be the most influential movie of all time . \\nbut before you send me hate-mail for not giving that title to \" citizen kane \" , hear me out . \\nmuch like \" citizen kane \" , \" pulp fiction \" has changed movie making forever . \\nbut i think the latter has had a tad more impact . \\n \" pulp fiction \" has actually ushered in a new era of film making . \\nit has altered the way films will be viewed . \\n \" fiction \" has spawned so many imitations , i\\'ve lost count . \\nsure , some have been excellent ( \" bound \" and \" the usual suspects \" spring immediately to mind ) , but any serious movie-goer recognizes \" pulp fiction \" as the original neo-noir of the 90s . \\nin this review , i hope to change all the people\\'s minds who have criticized it for it\\'s excessive profanity and violence ( which , by the way , isn\\'t really that graphic ) . \\nthe most brilliant aspect of tarantino\\'s masterpiece is the screenplay . \\nit is filled with so much classic dialogue ( the \" quarter pounder with cheese \" speech will go down in history ) , it should be required reading for any film student , if it isn\\'t already . \\nthe story ( told in unorthodox non-linear format ) centers around three main episodes , all of which eventually intertwine . \\nthe first , titled \" vincent vega and marcellus wallace\\'s wife \" , deals with a very loaded john travolta ( i forgot to mention the cool heroin shoot-up sequence ) taking mia wallace ( a star-making performance by uma thurman ) , his bosses wife , out on a date to a cool 50s restaurant called jack rabbit slim\\'s . \\nthey talk for a while ( with the occasional \" uncomfortable silence \" ) , mostly about a guy called tony rocky horror . \\nafter giving marcellus\\' new bride a foot massage , he was thrown off a building and into a greenhouse , giving him a \" speech impediment \" . \\nthey also partake in a cool dance contest and end up twisting to the chuck berry classic \" you never can tell \" . \\ni won\\'t reveal the rest of the story , but i\\'ll definitely say that it turns out to be a real bummer of a night , despite the cool trophy they win . \\nthe second story ( the least of the three but still four stars ) stars bruce willis ( proving he can play someone other than john mcclain in the \" die hard \" flicks ) as boxer butch coolidge . \\npreviously in the film ( like i said , it\\'s told in non-linear form ) , he had made a deal with marcellus wallace that he would take a fall in a match . \\nas it turns out , he not only doesn\\'t take the fall , but he ends up actually killing his opponent . \\nhe takes a cab to his half-witted girlfriend\\'s apartment , and to make a long story short , ends up going back to his own place to retrieve a gold watch , sort of a family heirloom explained by christopher walken in a hilarious flash-back sequence . \\non his way home , he bumps into ( literally ) marcellus . \\nthe two winde up prisoner to two hillbilly sex murderers , which results in the infamous \" gimp \" scene , which is very reminicent of the \" squeal like a pig ! \" \\nscene from \" deliverance \" . \\nthe last ( and best , in my opinion ) of the episodes features john travolta ( again ) and samuel l . jackson ( in the best performance of any supporting actor ever ) as two slightly off-kilter hitmen trying to rid themselves of a bloody car . \\nthey seek help with a friend of jackson\\'s ( played by the q-man himself ) , desperately in need of a stress ball . \\nthey end up calling a \" cleaner \" of sorts , played by the god among men harvey keitel , to help them out . \\nin the end , the story brilliantly loops around itself , actually ending where it began . \\nif you haven\\'t already seen the film ( or even if you have , for that matter ) , i suggest you invest your money in a copy of the letterbox collectors edition . \\nit features two previously unreleased scenes and the original film restored how it was originally meant to be seen . \\nearlier today , i bought this version and watched it a few hours ago . \\nwhat the pan-and-scan did to this movie is inexcusable . \\nthat version cut out , like , half the movie . \\nwhat i have missed in the past years of viewing this flick is amazing . \\nfor instance , when travolta and jackson are in the apartment near the end , the widescreen version allows you to see that several things on the walls make crosses . \\nthis might help explain the divine intervention that takes place . \\njust a theory . . . \\none of the things that pisses people off so much about this movie is that tarantino borrowed alot of scenes from other movies ( i . e . \\n \" psycho \" \" kiss me deadly \" , \" deliverance \" , etc . ) . \\nbut why shouldn\\'t he ? \\nit\\'s not like he out-right and blatantly stole . \\ngive the guy a break . \\nin case you haven\\'t already noticed , i believe \" pulp fiction \" is a supremely excellent film and one of the best of all time ( up there with such greats as \" casablanca \" and \" the godfather \" ) . \\ntrust me , you will not see a better film come out of the 90s . \\nand besides , it\\'s one hell of a ride . \\nnote : if anyone knows how i could get a \" bad motherfucker \" wallet , please e-mail me . \\nany help would be greatly appreciated . \\n',\n",
       "  b'the original babe gets my vote as the best family film since the princess bride , and it\\'s sequel has been getting rave reviews from most internet critics , both siskel and ebert sighting it more than a month ago as one of the year\\'s finest films . \\nso , naturally , when i entered the screening room that was to be showing the movie and there was nary another viewer to be found , this notion left me puzzled . \\nit is a rare thing for a children\\'s movie to be praised this highly , so wouldn\\'t you think that every parent in the entire city would be flocking with their kids to see this supposedly \" magical \" piece of work ? \\na tad bewildered , but pleased to not have to worry about screaming kids and other disruptions that commonly go along with family films , i sat back for 97 minutes and watched intently and with a very open mind , having great expectations for the film . \\nlooking back , i should have taken the hint and left right when i entered the theater . \\nbelieve me ; i wanted to like babe : pig in the city . \\nthe plot seemed interesting enough ; after the events that took place in the original , babe the sheep-pig has become a legitimate national phenomenon . \\nbut after a fateful encounter with a water well , arthur hogget ( james cromwell , who the movie could have used alot more of ) has been rendered bed-ridden for a number of weeks and the farm begins to go under financially . \\nthe only solution that his wife ( magda szubanski , going from delightfully charming to downright annoying ) can come up with is to make an appearance with their new celebrity pet at a national fair ( i think ) and to use the money they earn to pay off the bank ( set aside for the moment the fact that they could get more than enough cash from donations if they just made their case known to the public ) . \\nproblem is , the fair is being held in the middle of the dreaded \" city \" , a completely foreign place to both the pig and his companion . \\nsetting the main plot in motion , mrs . hogget and babe travel to the unnamed city and shack up with a sweet lady who just happens to love to help animals , despite the law that you cannot keep them in hotels . \\nit is here that we meet an array of eccentric characters , the most memorable being the family of chimps led by steven wright . \\nhere is where the film took a wrong turn . \\nup until this point , i had being having a rather enjoyable experience . \\nthe beginning featured some smart writing and funny situations involving the farm animals from the first one and even an inspired moment at the airport where mrs . hogget is accused of smuggling drugs . \\nunfortunately , the story wears thin as we are introduced to a new set of animals that reside at the hotel , none of them being even one-tenth as interesting as the characters from the previous babe . \\nthe main topic of discussion surrounding babe : pig in the city is the question of whether or not it is to dark and disturbing for small children , and i believe it is . \\nat one point , a dog is hung from his neck and slowly starts to drown . \\nat other times , we are treated to surrealistic flash-backs to mrs . hogget\\'s full cavity search at the airport . \\nin fact , the overall tone of the movie is rather bleak and depressing . \\nhowever , that is , as they say , neither here nor there because kids will probably not like the movie anyway . \\nthe animal characters and their plights were simply not intriguing enough to sustain my interest for an hour and a half , let alone entertain a child . \\nanother problem i found with the film was it\\'s sudden change of pacing and tone near the end of the story . \\nif you\\'re going to make a darker and more sinister sequel , fine . \\nit may not be my cup of tea , but at least it is a noble ambition . \\nbut to go from the downbeat feel of the rest of the movie and all of a sudden have slapstick finale with mrs . hogget swinging from wall-to-wall of a ballroom in elastic overalls ? \\nit just didn\\'t feel right and was more painful to watch than it was funny or entertaining , and the same goes for the rest of the movie . \\n',\n",

       "  b'john sayles\\' \" men with guns \" is about what happens to a society when brute force and constant threat of violence are the only means of gaining and maintaining power . \\nthe film takes place in an unnamed central american country , where the men with guns are the rulers . \\nmost of the country is divided into tiny segments - some are controlled by guerrillas with guns , some are controlled by army soldiers with guns , and all the spaces in-between are controlled by thieves , bandits , and terrorists . \\nall people not fitting one of those descriptions are defined only by their powerlessness . \\nhowever , like so many central american countries , this one also features modernity . \\nthere is an unnamed capital city that bears all the hallmarks of contemporary civilization : skyscrapers , hospitals , televisions , highways , etc . but , it might as well be in another country because those who live in the comforts of the city have either decided to ignore the violence ravaging the rest of the land , or else they are simply ignorant of it . \\nthe film\\'s main character , dr . fuentes ( federico luppi ) falls into the latter category . \\none of his patients , an army general , describes him as the most educated man he has ever met , and also the most naive . \\nfuentes is a true liberal , a caring man who thinks he can cure the ills of his country by fighting bacteria and ignorance among the indigenous indians . \\nwith government assistance , he has trained a large group of eager young medical students and sent them into the rainforest to cure and educate . \\nthis program was to be his legacy , and he repeats over and over that it was a good idea . \\nhowever , when he ventures into that same rainforest to visit his prot ? g ? s , he finds that things have not turned out as he has envisioned . \\nas he travels deeper into the forest , going from village to village , the story is always the same : the doctors were all killed by either the guerrillas or the army soldiers , usually for helping the other . \\nwhen dr . fuentes asks a village woman why the army killed one of the doctors , she replies simply , \" because they had guns , and we didn\\'t . \" \\nrational science and all its attempts to cure have been wiped out by the men with guns , because others\\' sickness and ignorance helps them maintain power . \\ndr . fuentes picks up several companions during his journey , all of whom are characterized by their loss . \\nfirst , there is a young boy named conejo ( dan rivera gonz ? lez ) , who has neither a mother nor a father . \\nnext , fuentes crosses paths with a thief named domingo ( dami ? n delgado ) , who deserted the army because he was tired of being jeered into committing murderous atrocities . \\nthrough his ordeal in the army , domingo has lost most of his self-respect , and defines himself only by his pistol . \\nalong the way , the group also picks up padre portillo ( dami ? n alc ? zar ) , a priest who has lost his faith . \\nas domingo is running from the army , so is portillo - he has been labeled a guerrilla sympathizer , and ran away from the village in which he was preaching . \\nlast , the group takes on a mute girl named graciela ( tania cruz ) , who hasn\\'t spoken since she was raped two years earlier , her innocence and even her will to live forcefully taken from her . \\nsayles two major strengths as a director - characters and setting - are abundantly evident in \" men with guns . \" \\n ( like many of his films , sayles might have tightened this one somewhat in the editing room , but a longer-than-necessary running time is a sin almost always committed when the director is also the editor . ) \\nhe creates fascinating , complex characters , especially dr . fuentes and domingo . \\ntheir uneasy relationship is also somewhat humorous in context of the film\\'s overarching theme of violence as power - domingo\\'s attempts to control fuentes with his revolver are constantly undermined by fuentes\\' belief that the revolver is unloaded ( at first it is , but later is isn\\'t ) . \\nthe setting is also as thick with detail as the rainforest itself . \\nsayles knows how to bring a location to life , whether it be an early twentieth-century coal mining town in \" matewan \" ( 1987 ) or a contemporary texas/mexico bordertown in \" lone star \" ( 1996 ) . \\nsayles is not a particularly inventive director - he likes to let his actors do most of the work - but he and cinematographer slavomir idziak ( \" gattaca \" ) successfully evoke both the beauty and the danger of the central american terrain . \\nsayles also maintains a strong sense of authenticity by filming everything on location in mexico , using all latin american actors , and having all the dialogue spoken in either spanish or native indian dialects . \\nthe one exception is a couple of bumbling american tourists who work not only as comic relief , but as evidence of just how clueless the united states is about what is going on a few hundred miles south of the texas border . \\nit would not be a stretch to say that \" men with guns \" is a depressing film . \\nin fact , the two feelings it evokes most are hopelessness and failure . \\nin addition to loss , the main characters are also failures at something , whether that be dr . fuentes failure to change anything through medicine , or padre portillo\\'s inability to stand up and be the martyr he always dreamed of being . \\nnevertheless , it is bleak material sayles has chosen , and he deals with it accordingly . \\nthe last shot of the film does offer a hint of hope , even in a world where , as one character puts it , \" nobody refuses the men with guns . \" \\n',\n",

       "  b'after a successful run in australia last year , and with much critical praise heaped upon it , muriel\\'s wedding opens into medium release this weekend in north america . \\nmuriel heslop is a withdrawn , overweight young woman living in porpoise spit , australia . \\nshe is often the target of her father\\'s frequent rants at the family , and drowns out her feelings of inadequacy with abba music and fantasies of marriage . \\nher self-loathing is such that only being wed shall she prove herself to be a success ; marriage will transform her into a new person who is respected and admired . \\nafter her four cliquey friends dump her , muriel plots to follow them to a resort where they are celebrating the honeymoon of one of the girls , and muriel\\'s wedding unfolds from there . \\ntoni collette plays muriel in a winning performance , conveying both the sadness of her character and her desperate eagerness to be accepted . \\ncollette gained a frightening 43 pounds in order to play the chubby title character . \\nshe has a natural screen presence and exudes charisma , easily winning the audience over with an honest , painful performance . \\ncollette basically carries the film , appearing in almost every scene . \\nmuriel\\'s father , bill \" the battler \" heslop , is portrayed by bill hunter as a slick politician/developer . \\nwhile chumming around with young fans and crowing \\'you can\\'t beat progress\\' ( his slogan ) , bill labels his family as worthless and embarrassments . \\nrachel griffiths plays rhonda , who becomes muriel\\'s cheeky new friend in the film . \\nshe has good chemistry with collette , and the film suffers when griffiths is off-screen . \\nmuriel\\'s tormenters , played by pippa grandison , rosalind hammond , belinda jarrett and sophie lee , are two-dimensional caricatures , all saucy , vain and bumblingly spiteful , though that is probably due to hogan\\'s scripting \\nmuriel\\'s wedding is essentially a genre teen comedy with more intelligence and a lot of charm . \\nhogan\\'s use of abba tunes ( which virtually comprises the entire soundtrack ) is interestingly appropriate , although its repetitiveness tires after awhile . \\nhogan\\'s script is right on the mark in terms of proportionately mixing comedy with muriel\\'s earnest quest for acceptance , and the gorgeous scene with muriel window-shopping beautifully illustrates the wonder that marriage has for her . \\nthe glaring pastel colours worn by the performers is an interesting touch . \\nmuriel\\'s wedding features a fine performance by toni collette and a charming , if a bit too straightforward and conventional story by p . j . hogan . \\non my four star scale , i give muriel\\'s wedding three stars . \\n',\n",
       "  b\"capsule : a ham-handed and over/underwritten morality play masquerading as entertainment , so muddled it doesn't even know what it's really advocating , if anything . \\na time to kill has been hailed as the best of the grisham adaptations , and it's easy to see why : it presents a strong , almost rancorously so , story ; it is full of good actors ( samuel l . jackson , matthew mcconaughey , sandra bullock , kevin spacey , charles dutton ) ; and it's ostensibly about some important social issue that we're all tangling with . \\nit is not , however , a good movie , and all of the reasons i've listed above have something to do with why . \\nright from the beginning , the movie is dead-set on stacking its deck as thoroughly and unrepentantly as possible . \\na pair of redneck whites , boozed and drugged out of their minds , kidnap a young black girl , abuse and rape her horribly , and leave her for dead . \\nafter their arrest , their father ( jackson ) takes an assault rifle and guns them down on the way to trial . \\nmcconaughey is then drafted in as his lawyer , and the rest is somehow strangely predictable courtoom movie dramatics . \\nthe acting is not quite what it should be , given the cast we have . \\nsandra bullock ( who is a good actress but not a serious one ) looks clueless ; spacey's accent switches itself on and off at random ( and he's given a totally thankless role to play as well , a role without an iota of depth ) ; and mcconaughey's role is stamped from the cardboard back of a cereal box . \\nthe most memorable role is donald sutherland's , and his is a bit part . \\ni always consider it an index of a movie's desperation when it is able to present shocking and outlandish events , and somehow not have them generate an ounce of impact . \\nthere is one scene -- a riot outside the courtroom -- that should have created incredible tension , but winds up playing out like a textbook exercise on how not to deploy a scene like this . \\nbecause the movie doesn't know what it's really about , it * can't * generate any genuine tension , and so it has to artifically inject tension through clumsy plotting . \\none of the ways it does this is by throwing in a whole subplot about a bunch of vicious kkk cross-burners -- which is tidied up so neatly that it borders on the nihilistic . \\ni was reminded of the despicable betrayed , which tried to tart up a fundamentally empty story by injecting vile , graphic acts of racism as little more than an attention-getter . \\nthe movie immolates an enormous amount of its potential by making a few critical mistakes . \\nfirst of all , the jackson character is not hard to judge ; there's no tension in his dilemma . \\nhe's self-admittedly guilty and should be sent to jail , no matter how moral his crusade . \\nthe old saw about how no court in the land would convict him , if he was white , is supposed to be the underlying theme of the movie , but it's never developed into an organic component of the story . \\nit just sort of floats around on top while the movie grinds away furiously with its plot mechanics . \\nanother mistake is in motivational logic : by not having the two white thugs arraigned first -- or maybe tried and then dismissed from lack of evidence , say -- we have that much less empathy for jackson's character . \\ni'm probably supposed to think that just because he had his daughter raped , we are * automatically * supposed to feel empathy for him , but that's precisely the kind of facile thinking that makes real justice impossible . \\n ( see the virgin spring for more on that note . ) \\nis jackson's character then simply insane ? \\nthat prospect isn't given terribly serious treatment either . \\none of the most aggravating things about coutroom movies is how little they seem to know about how the law works , or how lawyers get their information . \\nmcconaughey's character makes an important slipup late in the movie , when one of his witnesses turns out to have been convicted of a capital offense . \\nhow did the prosecution get this information ? \\nhow come he didn't get it ? \\nthe whole way these questions get handled are symptomatic of the movie's way of dealing with complex legal and moral questions in cheap screenwriterly slam-bang fashion . \\nthis is the biggest problem : the movie isn't about jackson's character , or his dilemma , or this case , or any of its ( frequently interesting despite the porcine writing and direction ) characters . \\nit's not ultimately about anything at all , except its stupid geared-down plot , which inches onwards in one unremarkable scene after another towards a totally contrived ending . \\nat two and a half hours , the movie is overlong and drastically overwritten : there's endless stuff about things which ultimately add up to nothing , and no writing about the material that should really matter . \\nit's all handwaving . \\nthe closing argument are also sneaky and underhanded , and underscored my suspicion that the movie is manipulative and unfair . \\nit's not easy to make a movie about something . \\nthe other day i saw kurosawa's phenomenal rashomon , a movie that is really about the way people deal with truth and reality ( or don't ) . \\na time to kill is as empty and ponderous a movie as i've seen in a long time . \\n\",\n",
       "  b'mickey mouse had better watch his back -- there\\'s a new critter in town , and he\\'s the nameless animal attraction of \" mouse hunt , \" dreamworks skg\\'s clever first foray into family fare . \\nalthough it runs out of steam towards its end , this live-action comedy still boasts enough energized slapstick and inventive set pieces to best disney\\'s entire 1997 non-animated , kiddie-oriented catalog . . . \\nbut consider that list includes dismal tripe like \" air bud , \" \" flubber \" and \" that darn cat , \" and it\\'s really not such a difficult feat to pull off . \\nstill , throw the two rodents in a boxing arena , and i\\'ll be hoping that the mouse from \" mouse hunt \" knocks some sense back into mickey . \\nnathan lane ( robin williams\\' significant other from \" the birdcage \" ) and lee evans ( last seen as a nervous bellhop in \" the fifth element \" ) play ernie and lars smuntz , befuddled brothers who have just inherited two unwanted assets from their late father ( william hickey , in his last role ) -- a dilapidated old string factory and a dilapidated old mansion . \\nalthough lars made a deathbed promise to upkeep the former , he and ernie decide to sell the latter for big bucks after learning it was designed by a famed architect . \\nbut there\\'s a lone obstacle in their way -- a single mouse lives within the walls of the house , and he\\'s not about to give up his place of residence without a fight . \\nmovies aimed at young audiences are rarely this visually exquisite . \\nthe effects blending the talents of 60-some live mice , one animatronic mouse and one computer-generated mouse are pretty seamless . \\nthe splendid production design seems to be straight out of tim burton\\'s mind ; the smuntz\\'s architecturally-unsound mansion is like something straight out of \" the nightmare before christmas , \" and the vortex of bizarre machinery in their factory resembles some of vincent price\\'s warped contraptions from \" edward scissorhands . \" \\n \" mouse hunt \" is a pretty dark movie -- even some of the humor can be grim -- but it\\'s hardly ever mean-spirited . \\nthe star of the show is neither the top-billed lane nor the titular mouse . \\nit\\'s lanky british comedian evans , whose hysterical bodily antics suggest a cleaned-up jim carrey without the obnoxious overkill ( note a toned-down but nonetheless outrageous impromptu striptease ) ; evans\\' banter with the ever-affable lane is funny stuff , too , and holds its own against the movie\\'s more flashy physical shtick . \\nvicki lewis ( beth from \" newsradio \" ) is solid in a supporting role as lars\\' money-grubbing wife . \\nand in a nifty bit of novelty casting , christopher walken is a macabre delight as a spooky exterminator who takes his job a little too seriously , popping a dropping into his mouth and noting to his tape recorder that the mouse has a \" calcium deficiency . \" \\nblech . \\na basically one-joke idea -- a mouse outsmarts a couple of bumbling humans -- is given a rather engaging execution . \\ntheir sparring is imaginatively realized ( i don\\'t think i\\'ll ever forget the sight of that tiny little mouse making his getaway on a rolling wheel of gouda ) , and although you really never fully root for either side , that\\'s okay -- a warm-and-fuzzy union between the two parties is practically promised from the first frame they share . \\n \" mouse hunt \" may take a while to get going ( the rather lengthy set-up could test the patience of some of the younger children , although i rather liked it , much in part to lane and evans ) , and the climactic sequence is allowed to play out for a bit too long , but this appears to be one family movie that most members of the family will be able to find agreeable , not unlike the original \" home alone . \" \\n',\n",
       "  b'please don\\'t mind this windbag letting off a bit of steam . . . i \\njust want to warn all of y\\'all not to waste your hard-earned $$$ on anaconda . \\nit\\'s not even worth a 99-cent video rental . \\ndon\\'t listen to ebert on this one ( he has no clue what he\\'s talking about ! ) \\nbtw i accompanied my friend to this one because she was * required * to watch it on assignment ( she reviews movies for a local paper ) . \\nnow i\\'ll actually back up my huffing and puffing . \\nhere goes : \\nmovie : anaconda rydain\\'s bottom line : wait for it to come on usa up all night . \\neven then , i doubt it\\'s worth the price of jolt ( to help you stay up that late ! ) \\nwhy do i hate anaconda ? \\nlet me count the ways . . . \\nfirst of all , this movie gets way too many snake facts wrong . \\nas an ophiophile ( snake lover ) , i can tell you that a ) anacondas would never reach a length of 40 feet , b ) they\\'re scared of people , c ) cases of snakes eating adult humans are extremely rare because human shoulders are too wide to fit in a snake\\'s mouth , and constrictor snakes don\\'t kill what they can\\'t eat , d ) people can outrun snakes with no trouble , especially heavy ones like anacondas , e ) if an anaconda did eat a human , it would need at least 6 months of sitting on its butt to digest the huge meal , therefore it couldn\\'t run around gobbling up everybody else in the cast , and f ) snakes have no vocal cords , so they can\\'t make funny squealing noises . \\nwhew . \\ni was prepared to suspend reality if the movie would have been worth it . \\nunfortunately , anaconda was about as suspenseful and exciting as watching paint peel . \\nmy friend and i even successfully predicted who would live at the end . \\nanybody can tell the bad guy is going to die eventually . \\nthat was a pity because his character was one of the few reasons my friend and i didn\\'t give up and fall asleep . \\nhe was the most likable character in the movie . \\nwho wouldn\\'t enjoy somebody who looks like a deranged walt whitman ? \\nanaconda did have its cute moments : arguments between ice cube\\'s character and the british guy , for instance . \\nhowever , those small flashes of wit were not worth the other hour and twenty-eight minutes of boring schlock . \\nthe writers had - and blew - a multitude of opportunities to insert funny lines . \\ni was quite disappointed with a scene where a young guy tells a young lady that the jungle makes him horny . \\ndid she retort with a clever , ego-withering comeback ? \\nof course not ! \\n \" i\\'m trying to work ! \" \\ngee , that\\'s even dumber than the crap comebacks i come up with . \\nshe could have told him to go find a knothole or something . . . \\n ; p but i will admit , there was just one scene where i was surprised at the outcome ( hint : it involves the evil guy and miss crap comebacks ) . \\nas for the plot , i\\'m still trying to find one . \\nthis movie was basically an excuse to get a boatload of people into dangerous territory where they could get snarfed by ridiculous , computer-generated anacondas with the eyes and fangs of vipers and the faster-than-gravity downward acceleration of a harrier jet . \\n ( harrier snake ? ) \\nnot to mention instant digestion so they could go snarf countless other victims . \\nthe writers tried to throw in some sort of plot twist ( should i call it a plot knot because it made no sense ? ) in which the sick guy\\'s g-friend kisses the evil dude and suddenly everybody hates said evil dude and starts trying to kill him . \\nthat was about as clear and understandable as mission : impossible . \\n ( if someone could explain that movie to me , i\\'d be most grateful ! \\nall the old-guy double agents looked the same ! ! ) \\ni wasn\\'t inspired by the acting , save for the evil dude . \\ni can\\'t blame the actors , though . \\nit\\'s not their fault they had a cruddy script to work with . \\nthis concludes rydain\\'s diatribe on a shameless exploitation ( and perpetuation ! ) of public fear of snakes . \\ncomments , flames , anyone ? \\n-rydain the atomic cheese , fresh from chernobyl dairies ! \\n',\n",
       "  b'i like movies with albert brooks , and i really like movies directed and written by albert brooks . \\nlost in america and defending your life are two of my favorite comedies . \\nhis humor is of a kind that is not very prevalent in movies today , inundated as we are with films which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator . \\nyou will rarely see any slapstick in an albert brooks film , while the dialog will not be as oppressive as in some of the independent \" talk films \" which are finding their way into theaters . \\nthe situations in which his characters find themselves are ones we can often identify with , but even if we can\\'t , brooks has the talent to make them comfortable , and therefore we laugh . \\nteenagers and jim carrey fans probably won\\'t find an albert brooks movie very funny , but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will . \\nput simply , brooks\\' comedy is intelligent . \\nmother is albert brooks\\' latest film , and it does not disappoint . \\nbrooks plays john henderson , a middle-aged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce . \\nhe makes an attempt at dating , but fails miserably . \\nhe then has dinner with his brother jeff ( rob morrow ) , a successful sports agent who seems to live the ideal life . \\njeff has a good job , a loving family , and most of all , a warm relationship with their mother beatrice ( debbie reynolds ) . \\nafter dinner , john witnesses a telephone conversation between jeff and beatrice , and is at the same time amazed and sickened by how hunky-dory the dialog is . \\nin comparison , beatrice always hints at a fault in john and his career every time she talks with him , and john gives it right back to her . \\nat the end of one of their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart john\\'s life , she says , \" i love you , \" and john replies with , \" i know you think you do . \" \\nthe thing is , beatrice is not overt with her criticisms , but instead gives them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nit-picking and guilt loading . \\nit\\'s the kind that goes something like , \" yes , dear , i think you do that wonderfully , but . . . . \" \\nit seems as though nothing he does makes her happy . \\nthere\\'s always the big but . \\njohn believes that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationships with women , either because of his flawed self-esteem caused by his need for validation , or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner . \\nhe comes to the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home , he should move back in with his mother for a while just to see what kinds of feelings come out , and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is . \\n \" a great experiment \" , he calls it . \\nbrooks\\' own brand of humor really shines in this film , especially in the interaction john has with his mother . \\nthere\\'s a scene where john has just arrived at his mother\\'s house , and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito , and having explained to his mother about the \" great experiment \" , beatrice asks , \" now explain to me again why you don\\'t want to stay at a hotel . \" \\nshe still doesn\\'t get it , and it is absolutely hilarious . \\nin the same scene , we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries to feed him food that is no longer fresh . \\nshe apparently buys in great quantities and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over . \\nwhen john points out the ice on the sherbet , beatrice tells him not to worry about the protective glaze . \\n \" you\\'ve named the ice ? \" \\nasks john . \\nhe\\'s also surprised at the variety of items beatrice keeps in the refrigerator , such as a twenty-pound block of cheese . \\n \" the freezer was a good invention , \" says john , \" but it\\'s not supposed to be used for everything . \\nthat\\'s why it\\'s smaller than the refrigerator . \" \\nit\\'s something most of us find strangely familiar . \\nbrooks is also a master at employing the non sequitur . \\nfor example , in defending your life , his and meryl streep\\'s characters are in a comedy club having a discussion . \\nwhen they\\'re finished and walk out , brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line , \" and so the moral is , if you have to fart , go outside ! \" \\nyou don\\'t know what the joke was because you couldn\\'t hear him during the entire scene , but i must have laughed for the next five minutes , it seemed so out of context . \\nin this film , brooks uses the same trick a couple of times to open or close a scene . \\ni don\\'t want to give them away , but suffice it to say they work just as well as they have in the past . \\njohn\\'s purpose for staying with his mother is to learn , and we as the audience learn right along with him . \\nhis mother is not the fascinating type to begin with , but as john spends more time with her , we learn things about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth . \\nwatching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit as enjoyable as the humor that accompanies it each step of the way . \\non screen , brooks does an excellent job playing this kind of character : you get the feeling he often believes he is the only sane person in an insane world . \\nin a way , he\\'s very much like yosarian of catch-22 , expect with something of an attitude . \\ncasting debbie reynolds as beatrice is perfect . \\nshe assumes the part with ease , even moving and speaking a little slowly , and is just so adorable it\\'s hard to get mad at her character . \\nthis only helps the audience to share the frustration john feels when dealing with her . \\nas his first choice , brooks originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice , but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband , who was beginning to show symptoms of alzheimer\\'s disease . \\nthat may be just as well , since reynolds lends a softness to the character which enhances it immensely . \\nrob morrow also does a good job at playing the younger brother who has always been mother\\'s favorite and , for all his success in his job and family , is slowly exposed as a mama\\'s boy . \\nthe only things that hold this movie back from being better are a couple of plot holes . \\na solid connection is not really made between john\\'s troubles and his reasons for living with his mother . \\nadditionally , the end results of the experiment do not necessarily jibe with the stated goals , and although this may have been sloppy screenwriting , how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this ?

       "  b\"in the grand scheme of mel gibson movies , payback was better than conspiracy theory , but not as good as braveheart or lethal weapon . \\nin other words , it's a decent couple of hours of entertainment , but 20 years from now if a they compile a list of mel gibson's greatest hits , payback probably won't be on it . \\ngibson plays a crook who gets double crossed by his partner after they heist a payroll . \\nmel's partner needed the money to pay off a mob debt . \\nso he puts a couple of bullets in mel , leaving him for dead , and goes on to pay off his creditors . \\nbut , mel isn't dead ( it would be a real short movie if he was ) and he certainly isn't happy . \\nto make matters worse , he wants his money back and is willing to go to any lengths to accomplish this feat . \\nhis ex partner has already used it to pay off the mobsters , so mel goes after the mob to get it back . \\npayback is often a very violent film . \\nto its credit , there are a few scenes that could have been very graphic , but the director ( i'm not sure which one -- more about that in a second ) made the choice to let the audience use their imagination instead of subjecting us to the usual gratuitous gore found in many films . \\nthe film appears a bit disjointed in places , which is understandable considering producer / star gibson wasn't thrilled with how the film turned out and wanted parts of it re-shot . \\nwhen the director refused , another one was brought in to do the re-shoot . \\nso as a result while the final product is apparently better than the original ( although personally i would love to see the original version for comparisons sake ) it does get a bit of a choppy feel to it towards the end . \\nit's always tough to make a film where the main character is a villain , unless that person has some redeeming qualities . \\nin this case , gibson's character has few redeeming qualities . \\nbut hey , its mel , so even when he is killing people in cold blood we are still rooting for him . \\nmy guess is that if that you put some other johnny bananas actor in this role , the audience would not be quite as responsive . \\ngibson is gibson , whether he is playing a suicidal cop or a stone cold killer , he does a good job . \\nhe almost guarantees that no matter what else happens in the rest of the movie at least the audience is going to get one good performance . \\nthis time out mel is surrounded by a good supporting cast , including maria bello ( as his love interest ) , william devane and kris kristofferson ( as mod bosses ) . \\nthe man who steals the show and unfortunately doesn't have a real big part is james coburn ( as yet another mobster ) . \\nif i had one big disappointment in this film , it would be that coburn didn't have a bigger role . \\nin the end , payback is a fairly solid action thriller , just not in quite the same league as some of mel gibson's other work . \\n\",\n",
       "  b\"this is the kind of movie that makes one appreciate disney's live- action george of the jungle . \\ntarzan and the lost city , the latest attempt to bring edgar rice burrough's legendary hero to the big screen , is one of the most inept and ill-timed of any tarzan adventure so far . \\nbadly conceived and poorly executed , tarzan and the lost city appears headed for a quick trip to video store shelves . \\ni have no idea why the producers chose now to bring back tarzan ; it's not as if there are legions of new fans clamoring for his next movie . \\nfurthermore , it's even more curious that this film is rated pg , which , by definition , rules out any sex or explicit violence . \\nand , while i'm not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek version of the story , tarzan deserves a slightly more adult approach than the one used in the embarrassing production . \\nof course , no tweaking of the content to change the rating could have saved tarzan and the lost city , since the film's troubles originated with the script and were propagated all the way down the line . \\nimagine george of the jungle stripped of all ( intentional ) humor , and you have a fair idea of what this tarzan is like . \\nwith its uninspired action and tepid adventure sequences , the film barely registers a pulse . \\nanyone in search of a relatively entertaining , family jungle adventure should check out the 1994 version of the jungle book , which uses the same basic elements to much better effect . \\nthe only worthwhile element of tarzan and the lost city is the pretty scenery ( which , unfortunately , includes the two lead actors ) . \\nthe film doesn't attempt to re-tell the origin story ? the thinking is that it has been done often enough . \\ninstead , tarzan and the lost city introduces us to lord graystoke a . k . a . john clayton a . k . a . tarzan the ape man ( casper van dien ) several days before his marriage to lady jane porter ( jane march ) . \\nhe is living happily in england , enjoying the benefits of being a land-owning noble . \\nmeanwhile , in central africa , the dastardly nigel ravens ( steven waddington ) , a self-proclaimed scholar and explorer , believes he has found the way to the lost city of opar , which he calls the cradle of civilization . \\non the way there , he and his band of mercenaries do all sorts of nasty things , like burning native villages , to earn the wrath of the locals . \\none shaman , determined to stop ravens from unearthing opal , sends a mystical message to tarzan for help . \\nwith lady jane following close behind , he returns to the jungle where he was born . \\nits patently obvious that casper van dien ( one of the pretty-boy heroes of starship troopers ) was not hired on the basis of his acting ability . \\nwith his plastic facial expressions , monotone voice , and complete inability to make convincing animal noises , his range rivals that of steven seagal . \\nhis pecs , however , are impressive , and director carl schenkel makes sure that he is given every opportunity to show them off . \\njane march , on the other hand , has to keep her shirt on , which may be a first for her . \\nsome six years ago , march give a solid performance in jean jacques annaud's steamy the lover . \\nsince then , she made the career-killing decision of appearing opposite bruce willis in the color of night , which exploited her every acting defiency . \\ntarzan continues this trend . \\nmarch may be attractive , but , at least judging by this performance , she can't act . \\nmeanwhile , steven waddington has serious trouble summoning up the menace necessary to be a really detestable bad guy . \\ninstead , he turns out to be little more than a nuisance . \\nthe story line is pure formula , which has largely been true throughout the years for almost all of the tarzan movies . \\nthe problem is that this one seems so childish and lifeless . \\nthe romantic elements are all contrived ? in fact , lady jane's presence is necessary only so she can be captured and subsequently rescued by her buff fiance . \\nthe special effects are truly bottom-of-the-barrel ( including some laughably bad men in ape costumes ? apparently , animatronics were too expensive for this production ) . \\nand , of course , as with all jungle movies , there are the obligatory cute animals . \\nover the years , the legend of tarzan has been one of the most popular sources for film series material . \\nthe most famous ape man was johnny weismuller , but no less than two dozen other actors have essayed the part ( including gordon scott , who is widely believed to be the best actor to tackle the role ) . \\nweismuller made 12 tarzan features ; van dien will probably fall 11 short of that number . \\nand , having seen tarzan and the lost city , i would argue that the movie-going public would have been well served if he had missed by 12 . \\n\",\n",

) \\novertakes the politics , which is too bad . \\nscreen time is spent with bulworth trying to cancel the request for his assassination while the hit man seems to be closing in on him . \\nthere are even a few gratuitous chase scenes , bulworth fleeing his killer . \\nthese scenes may have been necessary to keep the events of the film moving along , but it distracted and detracted from bulworth\\'s political ranting , which was much more interesting than the ever-present , obvious-looking assassin . \\nstill , most of the movie is original and very enjoyable , and beatty deserves most of credit for bringing it to the screen . \\nas the story and screen writer , he came up first with a good structure , then with good dialogue to back it up ( jeremy pikser co-wrote the screenplay ) . \\nas an actor , he was able to convincingly portray bulworth\\'s depression , then liberation and rebirth . \\nas a producer ( there were four others ) he was able to keep the movie free from hollywood\\'s indulgent formulas ( except for those inexcusable chase scenes ) . \\nsomeone else probably could have directed , but since he was there anyway , what the heck . \\nit\\'s too bad that there aren\\'t more movies like this around - movies that tackle political corruption in a way that challenges viewers to pay more attention to real politics . \\nafter all , much of the inspiration for bulworth is straight out of the news . \\njust a little perception and insight and you could write your own bulworth rants . \\njust don\\'t expect to be popular with the insurance companies . \\n',\n",

       "  b\"synopsis : in this movie , steven spielberg , one of today's finest directors , attempts to spice up the 1800s story of a long courtroom battle over the fate of prisoner cinque ( djimon hounsou ) - - a young angry man from sierra leone who was kidnapped into slavery - - and his fellow prisoners . \\ncinque and friends have landed a ship on the shores of america after escaping spanish slave traders , but since the americans don't speak cinque's language , the black men are hauled into court to determine whether or not they are legally slaves . \\ntechnically , since the international slave trade was outlawed at that time , people like cinque couldn't be kidnapped into slavery ; one had to be born a slave to be legally considered a slave . \\nlawyers baldwin and adams ( matthew mcconaughey and anthony hopkins ) must prove cinque and the others were captured into slavery , rather than born slaves , in order to get them out of prison as free men . \\nthree lengthy court cases are portrayed with spielberg's trademark panache - - flashy beginning , lots of facial close-ups , big music , and dramatic imagery . \\na final speech by adams is followed by an anticlimax where subtitles show what eventually happened to the various characters . \\nopinion : making a fictional movie is easier than making one about real life . \\nin fiction , one invents purposeful , clear-cut good guys and bad guys , puts the fictional characters in conflict , and takes the tale to its exciting conclusion . \\nreal life , however , consists of long stretches of boredom with a few dramatic moments and characters who stand around , think thoughts and do nothing , or come and go before events are resolved . \\nspielberg gives us a visually spicy and historically accurate real life story . \\ndjimon hounsou and anthony hopkins turn in excellent performances . \\n\",\n",

s . \\nalong the way writer/director darren stein forgets to give the film a life of its own . \\nthe film opens with a voice over from geeky fern mayo ( judy greer ) about the four most popular girls at reagan high : courtney shayne ( rose mcgowan ) who can basically be summed up as satan in heels , julie freeman ( rebecca gayheart ) a good girl with the face of a supermodel , marcie fox ( julie benz ) a dim-witted blonde who demands that people call her \" foxy \" , and liz purr ( charlotte roldan ) an angel in disguise . \\nliz is everyone\\'s favorite because she\\'s both beautiful and kind . \\nliz is about to turn 17 and , as a prank , courtney convinces the other girls to help her in kidnapping liz on her birthday morning . \\nin order to keep liz from making any noise courtney stuffs a jawbreaker into her mouth before they gag her . \\nthey then stuff liz in the trunk of courtney\\'s car but when they open it later , polaroid camera waiting to capture the moment , their lives will never be the same : poor liz has swallowed the jawbreaker and choked to death with it lodged in her throat ( the audience is treated to a few too many graphic looks at liz\\'s dead body ) . \\ncourtney , thinking fast , decides to pass the death off as a rape/murder and marcie and a reluctant julie assist her . \\nthings get complicated when fern discovers what the three girls are up to . \\nin order to keep her quiet courtney comes up with another plan and transforms geeky fern into \" vylette \" , hoping that she will also help to replace liz in the minds of the devastated students . \\nup until about this point the film is effective enough . \\nhowever , an investigation begins into liz\\'s death and the film becomes excessively dull . \\nthe recently rediscovered talents of pam grier are thoroughly wasted in the role of detective vera cruz and the film is downright insipid in its treatment of both the characters and the audience during this long middle stretch . \\ncourtney\\'s plan to frame a sleazy guy ( marilyn manson , in a brief cameo ) is never believable for a second . \\nmeanwhile , the audience is stuck watching a string of random events which fail to develop the characters or add anything of interest to the plot . \\njulie leaves the group and begins a lame romance with aspiring actor zack ( chad christ ) . \\nhe apparently gives her the courage to turn on courtney but the way things develop only make julie look stupid . \\nfern\\'s rise to popularity is equally lame . \\nwe do get the best scene in the film ( the only one with a spark of originality ) during this section . \\nit\\'s a smart and subversive bit where courtney gets the high school\\'s resident jock stud dane ( ethan erickson ) to demonstrate , using a popsicle , exactly what he would like for her to do to him . \\nit at least provides us with a look at courtney\\'s personality but the way the scene finishes doesn\\'t make any sense . \\nstein is very conscious of the teen movie tradition he is working in and not only freely borrows major plot elements but also includes direct acknowledgment of this with some stunt casting . \\nwilliam katt and p . j . soles ( students in carrie ) are liz\\'s distraught parents , jeff conaway ( from grease ( 1978 ) ) is julie\\'s creepy single dad and carol kane ( the frightened babysitter in when a stranger calls ( 1979 ) ) camps it up as principal miss sherman . \\nat times jawbreaker feels simply like teen cinema\\'s greatest hits but the audience is cheated with watered down interpretations of the best this genre has to offer . \\nthe only notable aspect of jawbreaker is the incredibly stylish look . \\nthe costume design by vickie brinkford and the production design by jerry fleming are both bright and vivid . \\nthey were apparently instructed to work from the color palette of a jawbreaker and the screen is always splashed with bits of vibrant color . \\ndirector of photography amy vicent , who beautifully lensed eve\\'s bayou ( 1997 ) , does a remarkable job here as well . \\nshot composition and camera movement is consistently impressive . \\nperformances are mostly sub-par with mcgowan providing only a few good moments ( compared with her excellent work in the doom generation ( 1995 ) and scream ( 1996 ) ) and gayheart making the biggest impression due to the sweet nature of her character and her obvious beauty . \\nnone of the actors look as if they have set foot inside a high school within the last five years with the exception of actress/singer tatyana ali , who has a small role as a cheerleader . \\nthe male cast all resemble male models and are credited with names like \" auto stud , \" \" college stud , \" and \" high school stud #2 . \" \\nthe soundtrack is decent and imperial teen\\'s catchy \" yoo hoo \" makes a bigger impression than any other aspect of the film . \\n',\n",

\" \\ni asked . \\n \" why are they churning out stale dialogue with machine-gun rapidity ? \" \\n \" why aren\\'t these characters being developed before their adventures ? \" \\n \" why is there a special effects shot in nearly every frame of the entire film ? \" \\nthese were just some of my questions early on . \\nlater , i asked , \" where\\'s the magic of the first three films ? \" \\nand \" why am i looking at my watch every fifteen minutes ? \\' \\nby the end of the film , i was tired , maddened , and depressed . \\ngeorge lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into a pointless , mindless , summer blockbuster . \\nthe phantom menace is no star wars film . \\ntake away the title and the jedi talk and the force , and you\\'re left with what is easily one of the most vacuous special effects movies of all time . \\nit\\'s an embarrassment . \\ni looked desperately for a scene in which a character is explored , or a new theme is examined , or a special effects shot isn\\'t used . \\nthere are a few of each , but they\\'re all token attempts . \\nthe fact is , george lucas has created what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for a movie and a pretty good showcase for digital effects . \\nthis is not what i wanted to see . \\ni didn\\'t want to leave the phantom menace with a headache and a bitter taste in my mouth , but i did . \\nthe story centers mostly around qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson , looking lost and confused ) and his apprentice , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor , who scarcely has a line in the film ) and their attempts to liberate the people of the planet naboo . \\nnaboo is the victim of a bureaucratic war with the trade federation ; their contact on naboo is queen amidala ( natalie portman ) , the teenage ruler who truly cares for her people . \\nafter picking up jar jar binks ( a completely cgi character , voiced by ahmed best ) , they head to tatooine , where they meet young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) and his mother ( pernilla august ) . \\nqui-gon knows that the force is strong with young anakin , and so the jedi knights take the boy with them on their journeys . \\nthe bad guys are darth maul and darth sidious , neither of whom have enough lines to register as characters . \\nthere isn\\'t anything particularly wrong with this story when looking at it in synopsis form . \\nthe way lucas has handled it , however , it unsatisfactory . \\nfirst of all , we don\\'t learn one single thing about qui-gon jinn . \\nnot one thing . \\nwhat was his life like before this film ? \\nwell , i imagine he didn\\'t have one . \\nthat\\'s why he feels like a plot device . \\nthis probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role , and why he\\'s recently retired from film ( i don\\'t blame him , honestly ) . \\nobi-wan , a character i was really looking forward to learning more about , is even less interesting . \\nmcgregor has just a few lines , so anyone hoping to see the engaging young actor in a great performance is urged to look elsewhere . \\nsince these two men are the focus of the phantom menace , lucas has served us a big emotional void as the centerpiece of his movie . \\nthings start to pick up when our characters reach tatooine ; young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshed-out character in the film , and lloyd does a thoughtful job with the role . \\ni was also hugely impressed with the sand speeder scene ; rarely is an action sequence so fast and so exciting . \\nand when anakin says goodbye to his mother , i found it moving . \\nalso fairly good is portman , and she manages to give a little depth to a character where no depth has been written . \\njar jar binks is one of the most annoying characters i\\'ve ever had to endure , but he\\'s more interesting than most of the humans . \\nas soon as the relatively-brief segment on tatooine is over , it\\'s back to the mind-numbing special effects and depthless action scenes . \\ni\\'ve seen many movies that qualify as \" special effects extravaganzas , \" but the phantom menace is the first one i\\'ve seen that had me sick of the special effects fifteen minutes into the movie . \\nthe reason is obvious : george lucas has no restraint . \\ni can\\'t say that i didn\\'t find the effects original , because i did -- the final battle between darth maul , obi-wan , and qui-gon is visually exceptional , as is most of the film . \\nbut i also found the effects deadening and tiresome . \\nmy breaking point was near the end of the picture , as anakin is getting questioned by yoda and the other jedi masters ; in the background , we see hundreds of digital spaceships flying around through a digital sky , and i wanted that to go away . \\ncan\\'t we have one stinking scene that isn\\'t bursting at the seems with a special effects shot ? \\ni got so sick of looking at the cgi characters and spaceships and planets and backgrounds that i really just wanted to go outside and look at a physical landscape for a few hours . \\nand then there\\'s the question of magic . \\nwhat was lost in the sixteen years between the phantom menace and return of the jedi ? \\ni have a feeling that lucas was so focused on how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel . \\njohn williams\\' familiar score is no help , nor is lucas\\' direction . \\ni think it comes right down to characters : there are none here . \\ni longed for the magnetic presence of han , luke , and leia , but i got no such thing . \\nand what about the ridiculous expectations ? \\nmine weren\\'t that high ; i simply wanted a film that showed me the roots of the films that i grew up loving , a story that had a few characters and a few great special effects . \\ninstead , i got two hours and fifteen minutes of a lifeless and imaginative computer graphics show . \\ni don\\'t hate the phantom menace as much as i resent it : i\\'d like to forget that it exists , and yet i can\\'t . \\nit\\'s here to stay . \\ni can only hope that episodes ii and iii have something of substance in them , because if they don\\'t , then lucas will have pulled off the impossible task of destroying his own indestructible series . \\n',\n",

search engine * * * \\na strange mixture of _shine_ , _basquiat_ , _angel heart_ , and grant morrison & dave mckean\\'s graphic novel \" arkham asylum \" , _the caveman\\'s valentine_ is a feverish tale of a homeless madman-cum-detective who , on the morning of february 14th , discovers a \" valentine \" just outside his new york cave : one of ella fitzgerald\\'s strange fruit , stuck in the crotch of a tree--a young male model murdered and frozen to a branch . \\nbelieving at first that his imagined nemesis stuyvesant , shooting evil rays into his mind from atop the chrysler building , is responsible for the murder , romulus ( samuel l . jackson ) is put on the trail of an avant-garde photographer in the mapplethorpe mould , david leppenraub ( colm feore ) . \\nhis minor sleuthing interrupted by the occasional delusional fit and bouts with an ecstasy of creation ( romulus was a brilliant julliard-trained pianist prior to his psychosis ) , romulus uncovers clues and harasses suspects on his way to convincing his police-woman daughter ( aunjanue ellis ) that even though he\\'s a nut , that doesn\\'t mean that he can\\'t solve a high-profile society murder . \\nevery moment an exhausting workshop of ideas , and every character the same , _the caveman\\'s valentine_ is a concept so \" high concept \" that it suddenly became clear to me that the film fits into the comic book genre of entertainment , with romulus\\'s \" caveman \" a slightly more mundane version of todd mcfarlane\\'s urban noir hero , spawn . \\nwith a long-vanished wife ( tamara tunie ) acting as a spiritual guide , the occasional social caste commentary , the secret base in a cave , a divergent genius personality with a network of informants and supporters , and a wickedly colourful arch-enemy , the film piles on the lurid comic book details and dizzying slapdash colours to such a lavish extent that i was vaguely surprised that the blue police cars weren\\'t inscribed with \" gotham pd . \" \\nthat being said , _the caveman\\'s valentine_ can only really succeed as a heroic fantasy , a frank miller graphic novel that has the audacity to portray the blood staining a field of virgin snow expanding to form the shape of a heart . \\nthe difficulties with the film spring from the misunderstanding that it somehow adheres to the conventions of a thriller or a police procedural when , in fact , _the caveman\\'s valentine_ is a superhero fable that takes on the cause of the homeless ( again like mcfarlane\\'s spawn ) while attacking the entrenched ruling classes in government and the arts . \\nit is no small detail that our hero , romulus , is not only named for a member of the ruling class who lived his life ( in legend ) without knowledge of his royal birth , but also that our romulus has turned his back on the comforts of the literati in favour of a mystical existence living in a cave in a park . in the romulus mythology , signs of romulus\\' royal blood is brought by twelve vultures , while in the film , the call to action for our hero comes in the form of not the carrion birds , but of the carrion itself . \\nwhether or not romulus of _the caveman\\'s valentine_ will found a nation , or , in the case of novelist george dawes green , upon whose novel his own screenplay is based , a franchise , the fact remains that _the caveman\\'s valentine_ is easily the most misunderstood film of 2001 thus far . \\nit , along with m . night shyamalan\\'s _unbreakable_ , is a mature cinematic extrapolation of the graphic novel format which has , since miller\\'s seminal \" the dark knight returns \" , redefined the comic medium as one suitable for mature ruminations on psychologically sticky topics . \\nreaders of sam keith\\'s brilliant \" the maxx \" comic series ( or of mtv\\'s short-lived animated adaptation of the same ) are already familiar with the idea of a homeless man placed in the position of knight errant and king of his own twisted demesne . \\nthe failure of both \" the maxx \" tv show and of _the caveman\\'s valentine_ ( not forgetting the initial backlash against _unbreakable_ ) suggests that the public may not be ready for america\\'s surprising contributions to dark fantasy . \\nluxuriantly lit , brashly saturated , and comic-panel framed with a virtuoso grace by cinematographer amy vincent ( _death in venice , ca_ ) , while inhabiting robin standefer\\'s ( _practical magic_ ) mesmerizing sets , _the caveman\\'s valentine_ is an unremittingly gorgeous film . \\nkasi lemmons , following up her brilliant 1997 debut , _eve\\'s bayou_ , which played on similar themes of manufactured realities and mysticism , fulfills much of her immense promise with a tale of seraphs and lost boys , artists and suffering . \\n_the caveman\\'s valentine_ is an elegant and piquant expression of hope for justice in a tilted landscape . \\nclearly not for every taste , when approached with the correct paradigm , it is one of the most stunning and intensely fascinating films of the year : a redefinition of the hero archetype for a post-modern audience with urine-stained wool trench coats in place of blue tights and red capes . \\n_the caveman\\'s valentine_ is a fine and a courageous film , crazy enough to suggest that the delirious yammering of an idiot savant is the best and truest paladin of order in the chaos of eliot\\'s rat\\'s alley wasteland . \\n',\n",
       "  b'i swear i have seen the edge before . \\nin fact , it reminded me of the bear , the river wild , and other various films mixed into an entirely different film . \\nhowever , the edge has done something that most action films should do , and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot . \\nin doing so , the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than , say , the peacemaker . \\nunfortunately , because of those overused moments , we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film . \\nbut leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and a few surprises to mess with your head . \\none surprise , in particular , left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script . \\naction films are a dime a dozen in hollywood , and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us , they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre : intelligence . \\neven horror films have learned this , a genre which is probably the least respected of them all . \\nthe river wild was one of the best action/suspense films i have seen from the 90s . \\nthe intelligence of the screenplay , and the suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to this day . \\nthe edge has the intelligence and smart characters , but this time the lack of originality is the downfall . \\ni must admit that it was very suspenseful , and had an original third half , but the first hour and a half is riddled with cliches and plot holes . \\nthis is an example of the final act saving the film , instead of the other way around ( as in the lost world ) . \\nif only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes\\' intensity , it could have become a great action film ( and i use the term loosely ) . \\nthe edge is pretty much a survival-of-the-fittest film . \\nbut taking scream\\'s lead , the edge makes fun of the genre\\'s cliches , and then uses them ( though not quite as effectively ) . \\ncharles morse ( anthony hopkins ) is the main character , a rich and very intelligent man who wonders what the accumulation of all this knowledge has brought to him . \\nfor once , we don\\'t immediately care for the main character . \\ninstead , we like bob ( alec baldwin ) , a photographer who is going to take pictures of charles\\' wife , mickey ( elle macpherson ) , out in the wilderness . \\nthey board a plane and head to a cabin somewhere in the arctic . \\ncharles\\' birthday is the same day , and he receives a gold watch from his wife , and a pocket knife from bob . \\nas action films go , these items do have importance to the rest of the story , but quite a bit more than we first expect . \\nsoon , however , bob wants to find a native to shoot pictures of because of his \" personality . \" \\ncharles , bob , bob\\'s assistant steve ( harold perrineau ) , and the pilot head off to find him , and as shown in the previews , hit a flock of birds flying south for the winter . \\ndown the plane goes , the pilot is killed , and the three are left to survive in the wilderness . \\ndirector lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot which is about to follow , and therefore has to create original ways to approach the situations . \\nhe succeeds often enough for us to enjoy the film . \\ntake , for instance , the entire man-hunting bear plot . \\nthis has been done many times in films with different animals , and even bears . \\nbut given the charles\\' intelligence , and bob\\'s uncertainty , many of the cliches are given fresh twists . \\neven charles himself seems to have seen these action films before . \\nmy favorite line of the film comes from charles : \" most people die in the wilderness because they didn\\'t do the one thing that could save their life . . . \\nthinking . \" \\ndespite the predictability of the main plot , a subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise , and made me smile when i realized that everything isn\\'t as it seems anymore . \\ni have to write cautiously as to not reveal this surprise , so instead i will avoid it entirely . \\nthe first two-thirds of the edge have many humorous moments to push it along , and some of charles\\' survival techniques seem possible , even making fire from ice . \\ntamahori is able to create a lot of suspense from the stalking bear , but whenever the bear is present , the characters lose all sensibility . \\ni have always wondered why characters in films walk over a log to get across water . \\nwhy not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across ? \\ni guess getting chased by a bear makes your thought process turn off for a while . \\nthankfully , we already have begun to care for the characters , and so we let this small detail slide . \\nbut some of the technical details are awkward , such as the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles and bob make ( where did they get thread and needles ? ) . \\nthe acting of the film is highly above average for a film of this nature , and borders on phenomenal . \\nanthony hopkins gives a terrific performance , creating his most likeable and layered character since remains of the day . \\nhopkins usually brings greatness to his roles , but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences\\' sympathy , something he definitely did not do in silence of the lambs . \\nalec baldwin gives one of his best performances i have ever seen ( it sure is better from his fair game ) . \\nbaldwin can be a good or a bad character , and here he succeeds at both in a way . \\nyou can never quite guess if he is a nice or a vllainous character until the end , and baldwin is able to handle the double-natured photographer . \\nelle macpherson gives a good performance , albeit slight . \\nshe isn\\'t in the film all that much , but for the scenes she does have , she handles as an actress , not as a model . \\nharold perrineau is a good actor , and his scenes are nice and underplayed . \\nhe is eliminated early , and i reveal nothing by saying this because it is inevitable and predictable . \\nthe edge is rated r for graphic violence , some gore , and language . \\nsome of the violence is a little too disturbing , even for me . \\nthis film is a nice change from the mindless action most of us are used to , but too many cliches bog it down . \\ndirector tamahori has created a very smooth and suspenseful action film out of recycled parts . \\ndavid mamet\\'s script , though , has a lot of humor to keep the first hour afloat , and the acting is solid . \\nthe best thing about the script is the ending which doesn\\'t end with the normal high-strung action sequence , but with a small detail involving a certain gift . \\nit\\'s a nice touch considering what we have had to go through with the bear . \\nand by the way , most people laughed when the film faded to black due to a large credit to bart the bear . \\nway to go , bart . \\n',\n",
       "  b'young einstein is embarrassingly lame , but that didn\\'t stop it from becoming a phenomenon in australia , where it became the third largest box office hit of all time . \\nin the u . s . , warner brothers is hoping the movie will follow in the footsteps of paul hogan , inxs , and shrimp on the barby to become the latest rage from down under . \\npersonally , i\\'m hoping americans everywhere will rise to the occasion and make young einstein a box office bomb . \\nyoung einstein sprang from the twisted mind of yahoo serious , who not only wrote , produced , edited , and directed the film , but also starred and did his own stunts . \\nhis creation is about as stupid and contrived as you\\'d expect from someone named yahoo . \\nthe movie takes substantial historical liberties in recreating einstein\\'s youth . \\nwhereas the scientist actually hailed from germany , the film finds him still living with his parents on tasmania , a remote australian island . \\nin addition to deriving the formula for energy and the theory of relativity , albert invents surfing , bubbles in beer , and the electric guitar . \\nyahoo plays einstein as a naive and unrefined country hick--a clown with an insatiable curiosity . \\nalthough yahoo\\'s performance is at first endearing , the one-dimensional characterization loses its novelty faster than you can say e=mc2 . \\nyahoo has created a charming family for albert , and the scenes on tasmania are often clever . \\nbut after the first twenty minutes , the movie quickly plummets and degenerates into a poor excuse for a comedy . \\nyoung einstein is hampered by its lethargic pace and inane plot . \\nyahoo must be an mtv addict because his movie features an omnipresent soundtrack ; unfortunately , the music is altogether gratuitous and quickly becomes overbearing . \\nalmost every other scene includes a blaring rock song that leaves you wondering whether you are watching a movie or a music video . \\nthe instrumental score , on the other hand , is generally playful ; yahoo uses such classics as the \" 1812 overture \" and the theme from the good , the bad and the ugly to great comic effect . \\nhalfway through young einstein , i knew for sure the movie was a stinker . \\nbut it wasn\\'t until the very end that i finally put my finger on why : the comedy takes its roots not from whimsical film fantasies ( such as young sherlock holmes ) but from cheesy prime-time sitcoms . \\nin fact , young einstein might have been more at home on network television , where its sophomoric humor wouldn\\'t raise any eyebrows . \\n',\n",

       "  b'i remember seeing the trailer of the black cauldron on the pinocchio video . \\nit really scared me , and i didn\\'t want to go see it . \\nhowever , after i heard about how wonderful it was , i wanted to see it . \\ni didn\\'t get a chance to do so , until now . \\nthe film , disney\\'s 25th animated feature , opens with a menacing shot of a great black cauldron unshrouded by mist as a narrator begins to tell the tale : a long time ago in the land of prydain , there was a king so evil , that his spirit was captured in the cauldron . \\nit has been hidden for centuries , and whoever possesses it will have the power to conjure up an army of deathless warriors , and with them rule the world ? and destroy it . \\nthen , we meet a farmer-wizard , dallben , and his young apprentice , taran . \\ntaran dreams of being a warrior instead of being a `pig-keeper\\' ( they have a pig named hen-wen ) . \\none day , as he gives hen wen a nice warm bath , the pig goes crazy , and dallben then realizes , after watching hen wen\\'s thoughts through a bucket of water , that taran must hide hen wen in the forest . \\nan evil ruler known as the horned king is searching for the black cauldron , and only hen wen has the power to show its location . \\ntaran leads hen wen into the forest , but of course , he loses her , and tries to go find her . \\nalong the way , he meets up with a mischievous little creature named gurgi , who desires `munchings and crunchings\\' , much to his dismay ( besides , he stole an apple that taran was trying to use to bring back hen wen ) . \\nwhen he hears hen wen\\'s squeal from far away , though , he races to her rescue ? only to see her get kidnapped by dragonlike gwythants . \\ntaran chases after the gwythants and finds himself staring at the horned king\\'s castle from far away . \\ntaran climbs the castle walls , and brings himself into the castle , where he attempts to rescue hen wen . \\nhe manages to do so , but he is himself captured and thrown into the dungeon . \\nthere , he meets princess eilonwy ( and her magic bauble , another thing which the horned king was hoping to use to find the cauldron ) , and the two escape through the deep castle walls . \\nalong the way , taran finds a sword in a burial chamber , and they rescue a comic bard named fflewdurr flamm , who has a harp whose strings break whenever he tells a lie . \\nthe three manage to escape the horned king\\'s castle , but not before taran realizes that his sword is magic . \\nas they rest in the forest , gurgi reappears , claiming to have found hen wen\\'s trail . \\nhe leads taran , eilonwy and fflewdurr , by way of `pig tracks\\' , to a whirlpool . \\nsuddenly , they all get sucked under , and they meet the fairy-like fairfolk . \\ntaran is reunited with hen wen , and informed that the black cauldron is hidden in the land of morva . \\nhe then devises a crazy idea that if they can destroy the cauldron , it would prevent the horned king from destroying their world . \\nwith the help of a grumpy fairy named doli , the four travelers manage to find themselves at a mysterious cottage . \\nit turns out to be no ordinary cottage ; three comically strange witches inhabit the place . \\nwhen taran tells them that they are searching for the black cauldron , they agree to let him have it ? in exchange for his sword . \\ntaran agrees , much to eilonwy\\'s horror , but at least they get the black cauldron . \\nbut ? the cauldron can\\'t be destroyed , only its evil powers can be stopped . \\nthe only way to do so is for a living being to climb into it of his own free will ? never to return alive . \\nthings take a turn for the worse when the horned king\\'s henchmen capture taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr , along with the black cauldron , and lead them back to the castle . \\ntaran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr watch in horror as the horned king unleashes the supernatural powers of the cauldron to ressurect his army of deathless warriors ( this is the most horrifying scene in the film , because here , a dead army comes alive ? ) . \\njust when all seems lost , though , gurgi reappears , and rescues taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr . \\ntaran is about to jump into the black cauldron , but gurgi stops him , not wanting him to throw his life away . \\ngurgi then jumps into the black cauldron , and the deathless warriors decay . \\ntaran tries to find a way to rescue gurgi , but he is forced to do battle against the horned king . \\nhe kicks the horned king away , who is then magically sucked into the black cauldron , where its powers immediately destroy him completely . \\ntaran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr manage to escape from the horned king\\'s castle just as it self-destructs . \\nthe witches then reappear and attempt to take the now useless black cauldron away , but fflewdurr stops them , saying that they `never give anything away , they bargain\\' . \\nin response to this , the witches offer taran his sword back , but taran instead has a new trade : the cauldron for gurgi . \\nthe trade is made ; gurgi\\'s seemingly lifeless body reappears before the heartbroken group . \\nas taran cradles him in his arms , though , gurgi stirs-he is not dead after all ! \\nthe happy group then returns home , where hen wen ( brought home by the fairfolk once the dangers are past ) , dallben , and even doli , await their triumphant return . \\nas spectacular as it sounds , the black cauldron really suffered a lot in its past times . \\nbefore ron miller was fired from his position as chairman of walt disney productions , he had bought a novel by lloyd alexander called the black cauldron , a sword and sorcery tale for the studio . \\nbringing this book to the screen was the studio\\'s fondest dream . \\nmiller , who entitled himself as the executive producer , promised that they would do so after they had proved themselves on other projects . \\nwhen micheal eisner and his executives arrived at the disney animation studio , the animators were struggling to complete the black cauldron . \\nby this time , things had gone really rocky for the animation department . \\nmany of the studio\\'s old men had retired or died . \\ntherefore , the animators suffered a hard time making this film . \\noriginally budgeted at $25 million , the costs raised to $40 million because of constant changes on everything ? and when it was finally released on june 24 , 1985 , the black cauldron was greeted by praising reviews from some critics , but somehow the film flopped . \\nthe film was rated pg and the film , although `disneyfied\\' from lloyd alexander\\'s chronicles of prydain ( which is what this film is based on ) , was much more scarier and darker than disney\\'s other previous efforts , such as the rescuers and the fox and the hound , which is probably why so many people considered it too scary and stayed away from it . \\nin addition , other critics rejected it for having `no heart\\' and `unmemorable\\' , compared to other disney animated features . \\nbut whatever the real reason , the black cauldron was a financial disaster , grossing only $21 million . \\nthe failure of the film grounded the studio\\'s animation department , and exiled the animation team to annex buildings in nearby glendale , and it seemed like animated features would no longer become a part of the studio\\'s reputation . \\nthe next two disney animated features , the great mouse detective and oliver and company , although a little more lighthearted than the black cauldron , didn\\'t do much better ( although oliver and company grossed much more than the black cauldron and the great mouse detective ) . \\nonly with the little mermaid did the studio regain its reputation for successful animated features . \\nas for the black cauldron , it was rereleased in some cities for a temporary time under the title taran and the magic cauldron . \\nfinally , the studio locked the film in the film vault and denied that it ever even was released . \\nbecause of all this , you might ask yourself , was the black cauldron really such a bad movie ? \\nthe people who had seen the film didn\\'t think so . \\nin fact , many people had calls to buena vista home video requesting for the film , but of course , they denied it . \\nfor a while , it seemed like the black cauldron would never be released to video ? until september 1997 , disney released the black cauldron to video in the united kingdom . \\nfew people imported the video from england and converted to ntsc ( including me ) and for those who hadn\\'t seen the film yet ( i am included here ) , they got quite a treat . \\nbut people who had bootleg copies of the black cauldron noticed that in the scene where the horned king raises his army of deathless warriors , about 12 seconds of ghoulish looking skeletons were slightly trimmed so that the film would get a u rating ( in the uk , the u rating means universal : suitable for all ages , kinda like their own version of g ) . \\nsomewhere online , a team of diehard the black cauldron fans signed a petition that said , `bring back the black cauldron ! \\' , and because of that , disney finally decided to release the video to the united states . \\nbefore that time , rumors online had been made that the video would be trimmed , like the uk video , so that it would get a g rating , and that they would add in songs . \\nthose rumors were put to rest when the walt disney company announced that the black cauldron * would * be released in its pg rated version . \\neven still , when it was finally released to the us , some reaction was mixed . \\nsome felt that it was indeed cut , but some felt that it wasn\\'t . \\nbut these where only minor criticisms which seemed laughable , since a film that was absent for thirteen years was finally available . \\nas for myself , when i saw the movie for the first time ( on converted ntsc video ) , i didn\\'t expect much at all . \\nin fact , i had heard so many mediocre things about it , that i didn\\'t think the film would ever be such a good film . \\nmuch to my surprise , when i saw the first few minutes of the film , i was asking myself , \" this is the same film everyone saw ? \\nthe one that flopped at the box office ? \\nthe one that critics and filmgoers alike called \" a bad movie \" ? \\nthis doesn\\'t seem like all of the above . \\ninstead , it\\'s a classic in its own right . \\nthe film has a wonderful cast of characters . \\nthere\\'s taran ( grant bardsley ) , an assistant pig keeper who would rather be a warrior than a pig-keeper , the story\\'s hero . \\nthe critics have said that taran is not likeable at all , but the opposite is true . \\nhe is brave , loyal , and eventually learns a lesson about friendship later on . \\nthere\\'s a likeable character here ! \\nnot that he\\'s the only likeable character in the film . \\nthere\\'s gurgi ( john biner ) , a lovable little , uh , thing who remains loyal to taran , even though they don\\'t quite hit it off at first . \\nbut another likeable character is the bad guy comic henchman , a dwarf named creeper ( phil fondacairo ) , who is loyal to the film\\'s imaginative and sinister villain , the horned king ( voiced gruesomely by john hurt ) , yet he also fears his neck . \\nthe other characters , including the sidekicks , a spunky , but sweet princess named eilonwy and the comic bard fflewdurr flamm , and three comically wicked witches who hide a dark secret , although pleasant and likeable , aren\\'t quite as well rounded as they should be . \\nthe story itself is an adventurous one , a quest involving the mystical pig , hen wen , the black cauldron itself , and an army of deathless ones with everything : a hooking opening to a spectacular finale . \\nelmer bernstein\\'s music also tells the story perfectly , in a dark , yet calming manner . \\nthe animation itself is surprisingly good considering that this film was created in the darkest time of the studios . \\neven though there are some occasional effects that are not quite good , like the ground opening when the black cauldron rises out of the earth , the animation overall is top notch . \\noverall ? this film is an entertaining endeavor . \\nfans unfamiliar to the lloyd alexander chronicles of prydain will get a kick out of this one , except young kids . \\nthere are some extremely scary scenes which are more darker than disney\\'s other films ( although some consider the stampede sequence from the lion king and frollo observing esmeralda in the fires of hell in the hunchback of notre dame are just as scary ) , which is the main reason why this film is rated pg . \\nfans familiar to the lloyd alexander series will recognize the differences between the novel and the movie . \\neven though it doesn\\'t have all of the ingredients of a true disney film , this film is a classic in its own right , and deserves a far better chance than what it has been given . \\nthat better chance has finally come . \\nwhatever reason about why the black cauldron was such a big failure seems to have disappeared , and the film has finally achieved its place among disney\\'s most proudest achievements . \\ni can\\'t help but think though , whatever would have happened if the black cauldron * was * a box office success ?

       "  b\"the question isn't why has grease been reissued . \\nthe answer to that one is easy : to celebrate the movie's 20th anniversary and to make more bucks for paramount's coffers because john travolta is once again a hot commodity . \\nno , the question that ought to be asked is : should grease be reissued ? \\nthe answer is not an easy one . \\ngrease is a fun movie , an entertaining fantasy of the '50s , embodying all the cliches of that era . \\nthe music is lively and the dance numbers , choreographed by patricia birch , are energetic and high-spirited . \\ntravolta was at his pinnacle as a sexual icon , cool , but non-threatening . \\nbut grease didn't break any new cinematic ground . \\nit was not a milestone in movie history such as citizen kane or easy rider . \\nwhat grease is - or has become - is the highest-grossing musical in film history . \\nok , let's not be a spoilsport . \\ngrease is a fun and entertaining movie , even though it stretches credulity to see such performers as travolta , olivia newton-john , taxi's jeff conaway and the multi-talented stockard channing try to act like high schoolers . \\nit's nostalgic to recall how good a dancer travolta was , and it's sad to think of what could have been had not a few missteps sidetracked his career . \\nhe could have become a musical comedy star in the tradition of gene kelly . \\ncinematically , the musical comedy has basically gone the way of the dinosaur . \\nbetween grease and 1996's evita . , you can probably count the number of movie musicals on one hand . \\ntwo reasons have contributed to the demise of the genre : the first is that movie audiences have become more sophisticated , no , make that cynical and jaded . \\ntoday , if a character began to dance and sing with no orchestra in sight , he or she would probably be hooted off the screen . \\ntoday's audiences lack the innocence , that belief in movie magic that is required for a musical to succeed . \\nsecondly , a lack of talent . \\nperformers with the charisma , the style , the larger-than-life panache of fred astaire , gene kelly , ginger rogers and judy garland are gone . \\nmost singers and dancers remain on the stage , and those who do succeed in movies usually wind up in serious dramatic parts . \\na good example is gregory hines , one of the greatest dancers in the world . \\nhe danced a bit in the cotton club , tap and white nights , but those were essentially dramatic vehicles . \\nso , perhaps the reissue of grease can serve a purpose . \\nif audiences show enough interest , meaning if the re-release earns the studio enough revenue , it may spark a revival in movie musicals . \\nperhaps not original musicals such as singin' in the rain , an american in paris or seven brides for seven brothers , but for broadway properties that have been in the planning stages for film adaptations for several years . \\nat one time or another , according to the industry rumor mill , hollywood has been set to create an animated version of andrew lloyd webber's cats , a filming of the popular phantom of the opera as well as les miserables and chicago , the latter reportedly to star madonna . \\nso , let this grease be the forerunner of an armada of movie musicals . \\nlet grease be the word that sparks this revival . \\n\",\n",

       "  b\"there must be some unwritten rule that states , one gets enlightenment not in the way one expects to get enlightenment but in the commitment given to seeking wisdom , even if it is a foolish road one is on and it seems to be leading nowhere . \\nin the exotic morocco of 1972 , a 25-year-old english hippie mother , julia ( winslet ) , of two sweet young girls , the 6-year-old lucy ( carrie ) and the 8-year-old bea ( bella ) , has arrived for a year's stay , with the self-absorbed mother oblivious to how her daughters might be adjusting to this foreign experience while she is searching for a change of life from her unfaithful poet husband ( she is not officially married to him ) and her cold one-room london flat , and is sort of looking for the eternal truth in the sunny climate of marrakech . \\nat least she says she is , as she is making some attempt to contact a sufi sheikh there who has all the answers . \\nshe has not planned things out too carefully , having no money , and the trip doesn't seem like it's much fun , more like a misadventure , with some romance with a local moroccan thrown in . \\ndrugs , a world-wide youthful phenomena during this period , where many westerners came to morocco to smoke the good hashish found there and to live the 'good life' cheaply , and to be in a spot where they did not have to worry about being hassled by the local authorities , even though drugs are illegal there . \\nbut this is not shown as one of her reasons for being here . \\nin this film , the subject of drugs is never broached , only hinted at in an off-handed but slurring way , as the hippie commune is shown in a negative light , strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken . \\neven the ones coming here for spiritual reasons , to follow the mystical sufis , seem lost following a culture that is far different from where they were coming from . \\nthe film is based on the novel that contained the autobiographical experiences of sigmund freud's grand-daughter , esther freud , who traveled here in the 1960s with her mother and sister . \\nit is written by the director's brother , who has previously directed regeneration , the playboys , and trojan eddie . \\nthe title of the film comes from the squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives the little girls . \\nwith julia strapped for cash and not receiving a needed check her husband often forgets to send her , she is prevented from seeing the greatest living sufi who is located in algeria ; so instead , she meets an acrobat street performer in the bazaar , bilal ( said taghmaoui ) . \\nhe becomes her lover , taking the place of her husband as a father figure for the girls . \\nthe girls readily accept him , and there is no big-to-do made about their openly sexual relationship , but the girls really don't know what to make of the relationship . \\nit especially bothers bea , who is embarrassed by her mother's loose attitude and wants to go home . \\nthings go surprisingly sour when bilal takes them to stay in his small village . \\nit seems only that bilal's charm is matched by his shiftlessness , as he has a wife who still lives there . \\nthis scene didn't make too much sense as to why he would take them there knowing the situation , unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people , also . \\nbut i doubt that . \\nthe family is now stuck without money in a backward area trying to decide what to do next , as they hitch a ride away from there with a truck driver who nearly kills them when he falls asleep by the wheel . \\nlucy takes it all in stride and has a good disposition for travel , while bea just wants to go to a school and learn something and be a 'normal' girl . \\nthe beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet , as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its bustling street scenes , expansive views , illustrious mosques , and grand sunsets . \\nkate enacts the feel of what it was like to be a westerner , living out the countercultural experiences while awaiting to gather her sensibilities again and was fortunate enough to be able to go home the better off for her experiences , as many a drop-out reluctantly had to do after their stay ran out of money and purpose . \\nthe background music from groups like america and jefferson airplane , provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp film . \\nthe only hope was that the two innocent girls would not be permanently harmed while on this sojourn , a venture that should be reserved only for those of college age or older who choose to go there for themselves . \\nthe family's travel , which is on the edge , has julia waking up screaming from dreams that are bleakly haunting ; but , when she gets up , all there is , is this splendid emptiness all around her and a vacuous life that is starting to bother her . \\nthat marrakech is disarmingly gorgeous and that london is old hat to her , is starting to wear thin in her thoughts . \\nit will dawn on her , when bea takes ill , as she reflects on what the sufi guru tells her , whom she finally meets and is driven to tears in his presence . \\nhe is the guru who replaced the one she wanted to see but who died before she got a chance to see him . \\nthe new guru is grounded in reality , something she is not grounded in , and seems to tell her what she couldn't comprehend from anyone else , even comforting her , by telling her that her tears are memories- a gift from god . \\nthe film's weakness was the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor ( she was there basically to be just escaping from her situation ) and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia . \\nthe storyline about a helpless single parent , detracted from the vibrant experiences many others of her same baby-boom generation had during their trip to morocco , who were taken in by the mystical culture of sufism , a teaching that has a lot to offer its followers , contrary to the impression the film might give , seemed to pass her by . \\nher knowledge of that trip is only surface deep , at best . \\nshe perhaps would have been better off not taking the kids along , smoking some hashish , and have been less assured of herself but to have behaved more like a hippie and she wouldn't have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey . \\nafter all , the mystical trip is the journey . \\nthe film's strength is in how all the characters are shown for what they are , and no one is that good or that bad , or judged too harshly for their shortcomings . \\nbilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity . \\nthe little girls are precocious but they are lovable . \\njulia , the cornerstone the film is built on , is a mother who cares about the children but doesn't know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them . \\nshe was trying to escape from reality and that by returning to london , she has another chance to see if she can find the key to this world or whatever world she is looking for and should no longer have nightmares about where she's at . \\nthis is a very freudian way to look at things , as this sudden realization , that things are not right puts an an end to her eastern hippie odyssey , at least , for the time being . \\nand , after all is said and done , who's to say if the children are also not better off for surviving their experiences , just like she probably was ! \\n\",\n",
       "  b\"with his last two films - shine and snow falling on cedars - australian director scott hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the best out there , and his latest , hearts in atlantis , is no different . \\nits structure - beginning and ending in present day with one long flashback in the middle - is similar to the green mile , which is a bit ironic considering both were based on stephen king books . \\nthe parallels don't end there , either . \\natlantis was adapted by william goldman , who had previously penned the big-screen version of misery and is in the process of working on the script for king's dreamcatcher . \\neven the film's content is a bit reminiscent of mile . \\nin fact , it's the perfect blend of the feel-good '60s nostalgia of stand by me ( also by king ) and mystical power hokum of mile . \\nking's atlantis is a book comprised of five related short stories , but the main focus here is on the first ( and longest ) tale , called low men in yellow coats ( the film's title comes from the second chapter ) . \\nit's set in 1960 harwich , connecticut , where 11-year-old bobby garfield ( anton yelchin ) lives in a boarding house run by his cold , self-centered mother elizabeth ( hope davis , joe gould's secret ) , who seems to care more about her wardrobe than her son . \\nbobby spends his time with his two closest friends , john sullivan ( will rothhaar ) and tomboy carol gerber ( mika boorem ) , who become something like the kevin , paul and winnie of harwich . \\nwhen a new tenant moves into the vacant room , the fatherless bobby finds a male role model in ted brautigan ( anthony hopkins , hannibal ) , a mysterious stranger who is vague enough about his past to make bobby's mom suspicious enough to at least momentarily turn her head away from the mirror . \\nted teaches his young neighbor about the wonders of literature ( after his cheapskate mother gives him a library card for his birthday ) , dispenses prophetic words of wisdom and even pays bobby one dollar a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for the low men , a group of people chasing ted to exploit his special powers . \\ni won't go into what these powers are , but they're considerably toned down from the book ( and don't involve black stuff flying out of ted's mouth , a la mile ) . \\natlantis' present-day setting which bookends the film is based on the novel's final chapter , titled heavenly shades of night are falling , and features david morse ( in yet another connection to the green mile ) as a married , middle-aged bobby who learns of the death of both of his childhood friends and returns to the dilapidated boarding house in which he spent his formative years . \\natlantis is nowhere near as flashy as hicks' cedars , which is disappointing but understandable considering the switch from the completely amazing robert richardson to the occasionally amazing piotr sobocinski , the oscar-nominated cinematographer behind krzysztof kieslowski's red . \\nthe acting is solid from everyone , including hopkins , who never once makes you think of dr . lecter . \\nmost impressive are youngsters yelchin and boorem , who both had tiny parts in along came a spider . \\nwhile i didn't really have much of a problem with goldman's screenplay , i do need to point out at least one inconsistency . \\ngoldman , for those of you who don't read premiere , writes what seems like an annual criticism of everybody else's films , carefully explaining why they all suck , make no sense and insult their audiences , while somehow failing to mention the crap that he's penned ( like the general's daughter ) . \\nit's mean-spirited but fun to read , mostly on account of nobody else in hollywood having the balls to say anything remotely negative about anybody else in the business ( including michael jackson , o . j . \\nand robert blake ) . \\nin atlantis , which is supposed to be told through the eyes of young bobby , one would assume he would have to be in each scene in order to have the memory to which to flash back . \\nwell , he's not , and it doesn't make sense . \\n1 : 41 - pg-13 for violence and thematic elements \\n\",\n",

       "  b'mpaa : not rated ( though i feel it would likely be pg , for martial-arts violence . ) \\nwith three movies already ( re ) released theatrically in america , and at least three more on their way , jackie chan is one of the newest \" hot properties \" in action adventure stardom , and it\\'s just about time . \\nfor over twenty-five years , jackie\\'s been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong , thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy . \\n \" drunken master \" has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to \" make it big \" --this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong . \\ni\\'m not entirely sure why , exactly . \\nin many ways , \" drunken master \" is similar to most of jackie\\'s other early films , such as \" fearless hyena \" i and ii , \" master with cracked fingers \" , \" half a loaf of kung fu \" , \" spiritual kung fu \" , and others . \\nin fact , looking at all these early films together , one gets the impression that they were stamped out , cookie-cutter style , at a rate of four to six per year , all using the same casts and telling very similar stories . \\nto be honest , i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste . \\nthey\\'re quite different from action movies as we know them in america . \\nthese films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past , with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together . \\n \" drunken master \" , though its plot is tighter than some , is no exception . \\n ( as an aside , \" drunken master \" was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw , and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen . . . in \\na movie theater in seattle , as part of an asian film festival . \\nat the time , i didn\\'t really think it was anything special . . . but \\nafter having seen more films like it , it\\'s kind of grown on me . ) \\n \" drunken master \" \\'s storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies , such as \" fearless hyena \" i and ii and \" master with cracked fingers \" --slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harsh-seeming master , and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end ( a formula that has been \" adapted , \" to put it kindly , by american films such as karate kid ) . \\nmore specifically , jackie chan plays the part of wong fei-hong , aka \" naughty panther , \" a fun-loving , practical-joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good , but not _quite_ good enough . \\nafter embarrassing his instructor\\'s assistant by beating him roundly , then beating up a bully in a marketplace , wong fei-hong tries to hit on a pretty girl , but discovers that she , and her mother , can hit back , better than he can . . . and \\nis further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt , respectively . \\nhis father , wong kei-ying , is unhappy about this , and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages . \\nkei-ying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment , which fei-hong does not like at all . \\nwhile escaping from this punishment , fei-hong meets up with a drunken old man , who proceeds to thrash him soundly , then take him on as a student and thrash him some more . \\nthis turns out to be su hua-chi , a legendary master of drunken-style kung fu . \\nhe assigns fei-hong a series of bizarre tasks , such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame , cracking walnuts with his hands , and other such exercises , that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up . \\nthen , when he\\'s ready , he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu . \\nunfortunately , the lazy fei-hong only practices six of them . . . \\n \" drunken master \" features some wonderful martial arts sequences , with jackie winning some fights and losing others . \\nit\\'s been said before , but i\\'ll say it again--these fights don\\'t just _happen_ , they\\'re as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance , and it shows . \\nin his fights , jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment-- benches , jugs , cups , bowls , fruits and vegetables--often in new and surprising ways . \\nthe fight scenes , particularly those toward the end of the film , are unparallelled in most american films . \\nwhether jackie wins or loses , it\\'s really something to see . . . and \\nit\\'s often as funny as anything , too . \\nand funny is the other thing jackie chan is very , very good at . \\nthere\\'s very little that\\'s new in this movie--jackie winning fights , jackie getting beaten badly by a master , jackie going through punishment or training . . . these \\nschticks have all been seen before , in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties . \\nbut they\\'re still hilarious as ever . \\nlikewise , jackie has a _great_ supporting cast , many of whom were also in other early jackie films , and they\\'re often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own . \\nthe really big thing about \" drunken master \" , though , that inspired several copycats ( including a couple starring jackie himself ) and a sequel fifteen years later , was the drunken-style kung fu . \\ni\\'m not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of kung fu , but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security . . . and \\nit apparently helps if you\\'re drunk while you\\'re doing it . \\ngenuine or not , i have to admit , there\\'s just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize what\\'s going on . \\ncome to think of it , perhaps this element is what accounts for this film\\'s success over any of the other jackie films . . . it\\'s \\nnot just martial arts , it\\'s the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go , \" whoa . . . \" \\non the negative side , the cinematography in this film is nothing special , the film stock is rather primitive , the plot is often rather slow , and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background . \\n \" gone with the wind \" , this isn\\'t . \\nstill , if you like martial arts films , or like what you\\'ve seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more , give it a shot . \\nit\\'s much more \" real \" than chuck norris or jean-claude van damme . \\nyou might very well like it . \\nanother interesting thing about \" drunken master \" has to do with its video availability in the us . \\n \" drunken master \" is the only early jackie chan movie that i know of that you can find in its original , letterboxed , hong kong subtitled form , commercially available on vhs ( from magnum video , in a gold box , for about $10 ) . \\nthere are plenty of other early jackie films around , but these are typically either in dubbed , pan-and-scanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase . \\nthankfully , \" drunken master \" , at least , is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen , at a very affordable price . \\nif you like \" drunken master \" , take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there ( even the dubbed ones aren\\'t really _too_ bad . . . if \\nnothing else , you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue ) . \\ni particularly recommend \" spiritual kung fu \" , \" half a loaf of kung fu \" , the \" fearless hyena \" movies , and \" snake & crane arts of shaolin \" . \\nalso , the mostly-unrelated-storywise sequel , \" drunken master ii \" , will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year ( though what its american-release title will be is still uncertain ) and comes _highly_ recommended by this reviewer . \\nalso , for a rather different interpretation of the character wong fei-hong ( who is in fact a popular figure from chinese

       "  b'michael robbins\\' hardball is quite the cinematic achievement . \\nin about two hours , we get a glancing examination of ghetto life , a funeral with a heartfelt eulogy , speeches about never giving up , a cache of cute kids ( including a fat one with asthma ) , a hard-luck gambler who finds salvation in a good woman and a climactic \" big game , \" where the underdogs prove to have a bigger bite than anyone ever imagined . \\nall that\\'s needed is a guy getting hit in the nuts and a food fight to have the first film solely based on cinematic clich ? s . \\ni can\\'t wait to see the deleted scenes when it comes out on dvd . \\nobviously , hardball is a strikeout of a movie that never gets the bat anywhere near the ball . \\nit stars keanu reeves as the aforementioned gambler , who seems to owe every bookie in chicago an amount of money that rivals the gross national product of guam . \\nout of solutions , he begs his successful corporate friend ( the always welcome mike mcglone ) to lend him $5 , 000 . \\ninstead , mcglone offers reeves the chance to help him coach a youth baseball team from the projects for a nice weekly stipend . \\nreeves , who wants to keep his fingers , accepts the offer , but discovers mcglone is only too happy to let him handle the team entirely . \\nthe drowsy-voiced protagonist must teach the sassy inner city kids the baseball basics in a life of absentee parents and merciless gangs . \\nand maybe , just maybe , they\\'ll play in the big championship game . \\none of the glorious surprises in the screenplay by john gatins ( summer catch ) , adapted from daniel coyle\\'s non-fiction book , is that there aren\\'t any . \\nthe movie coasts from heartfelt moment to heartfelt moment like a zombie . \\nthat wouldn\\'t be so bad , if the characters had an ounce of subtlety or humanity to them . \\nmost of the kids\\' time is spent yelling at each other , talking in slang and acting surprised . \\nthere\\'s little that\\'s naturally amusing about them , as they all seem to know the cameras are rolling . \\nthe worst of the lot is a tough-talking younger player ( dewayne warren ) whose sole purpose , as the movie unfolds , is being an emotional pawn , a tactic so utterly despicable i can\\'t find the right words to express myself . \\nthe adults also don\\'t fare well . \\nreeves is impressively uninspiring as the down-on-his-luck loser . \\nthe character is poorly written , but reeves gives another charisma-free performance . \\nevery time he speaks , he sounds like he just got up from a long nap and is gradually waking up . \\nkids are supposed to rally around this guy ? \\ndiane lane , who co-stars as reeves\\' obligatory love interest , remains a glowing screen presence ( see my dog skip for better proof ) . \\nit\\'s too bad that her role here consists of uttering lines like , \" these kids trust you , and they don\\'t trust anyone ! \" \\nthen there\\'s d . b . \\nsweeney as an evil rival coach and john hawkes as reeves\\' scummy betting buddy and other unoriginal characters you\\'ve seen before and hope never to see again . \\ni wanted hardball to be good . \\nrobbins\\' varsity blues was a funny and alternately taut tale of texas high school football that had ali larter smothered in whipped cream and jon voight sneering at everything that moved . \\ni haven\\'t seen robbins\\' goofy ready to rumble in its entirety , but i am intrigued that \" macho man \" randy savage and martin landau can exist in the same movie without there being serious worldwide repercussions . \\nrobbins obviously needs to go back to his forte -- making sports movies for guys and not cutesy , cuddly pap such as hardball , which also manages to annoy and insult the audience . \\nhere\\'s hoping that happens in the immediate future . \\n',\n",
       "  b' \" party camp , \" is one of the most mindnumbingly brainless comedies i\\'ve seen in awhile . \\na late rip-off of the \" meatballs \" series , the film follows a group of young camp counselors at camp chipmunk . \\nthat\\'s really about all that can be said about the \" plot \" because nothing much happens , except that the main character , wise-cracking jerry ( andrew ross ) , has the hots for a cute blonde ( kerry brennan ) , and there is a big contest in the climax . \\nhow fun ! \\nsince , \" party camp , \" has practically no screenplay and there is no talent at all involved , the least the makers could have done was make it raunchy and exploitative . \\nit\\'s not that i think exploitation is necessarily a good quality , but when you are talking about a dull turkey like this , the least that could have been done would be to fill it with a lot of mindless sex . \\neven a psychopathic slasher at the camp would have done the trick . \\nat least , then , it wouldn\\'t have been such a chore to sit through . \\nnever before have i seen so many jokes fall astoundingly flat . \\nthe comedy was easy to spot , but it wasn\\'t the least bit funny . \\nit was groan-inducing . \\nconstantly throghout , i was asking myself if director gary graver actually thought this movie was worth anything . \\nso what saves , \" party camp , \" from the dreaded zero star rating ? \\nwell , that\\'s simple : jewel shepard , as a flighty bimbo , was admittedly fun to watch . \\nalthough nothing could have saved this film from the lowest depths of motion picture trash , at least if the film had centered on shepard , she might have been able to add a little spice to an otherwise rancid , low-budget teen comedy . \\n',\n",
       "  b' \" a man is not a man without eight taels of gold . \" \\nstarring sammo hung , sylvia chang ; directed by mabel cheung ; written by cheung and alex law ; cinematography by bill wong \\neight taels of gold begins as a fish out of water story and at some point becomes a love story involving two people whose past choices prevent the fruition of their love . \\nneither aspect of the movie is entirely successful , but both are good enough . \\nand along the way there is one perfect scene , which is one more than you find in most films . \\nslim ( played by portly sammo hung , better known as a star and director of hong kong action movies ) is a chinese immigrant who drives a yellow cab in new york . \\nwhen the movie opens , we see him shouting obscenities at another taxi driver . \\nhe does not seem particularly out of place . \\nin fact , he is about to return to visit his home in rural china for the first time in sixteen years , spending most of his life savings in the process , and it is there that he will become the proverbial fish out of water , as he realizes that you can never go home . \\nhe brings with him some statue of liberty cigarette lighters , cheap sunglasses , and lobsters ( which have to be large , to prove they\\'re american ) --the tokens of his success . \\nhe also wears a gold chain and a gold watch , because without eight taels of gold , a man is not a man ( my dictionary tells me that taels are a unit of weight used in the far east , and i assume the phrase is a chinese proverb ) . \\nhe loses most of this stuff--except the gold--when his van crashes into a river and he has to hitch a ride , so to speak , on a raft along the river which runs past his parents\\' village . \\nwhen he arrives unannounced , he almost induces cardiac arrest in his father . \\nall of this has the makings of a routine comedy , and the movie has its amusing moments , as when the villagers take turns giving slim gifts during a celebration of his homecoming , and they all give him birds , so by evening\\'s end he is surrounded by turkeys , ducks , geese and other sundry fowl . \\nbut eight taels is not a comedy--it is a sad , sweet story about the choices people make , and how they are sometimes irreparable . \\ndirector mabel cheung ( an autumn\\'s tale , the soong sisters ) sees clearly what it is like to have lived half of your life in one country and half in a country on the other side of the world--what it is like to no longer have a place to call home . \\nslim does not belong in china , nor does he belong in america , where he can barely speak the language . \\nseeing water buffalo in the fields and rafts poled down the river and fireworks exploding gloriously in the sky over a small village , we come to know the world slim left behind , and it seems as if he too is knowing it for the first time , and wishes it felt more like home . \\nthe condition of the expatriate is eloquently portrayed ; i , being one , was sympathetic . \\non his way to his parent\\'s village , slim hooks up with jenny ( sylvia chang ) , whom he knew when she was a girl nicknamed odds-and-ends , which is what he continues to call her , although she is now a mature , professional , attractive woman , to be married in the spring to an american-chinese man . \\nslim and odds-and-ends fall for each other . \\nthat\\'s predictable . \\nthe manner in which their ( non- ) romance is played out is not . \\nthe emotions involved are adult and complex , and the film avoids cheap solutions to their dilemma . \\nit\\'s typical , for instance , that the fianc ? in this sort of plot be a colossal jerk , because it makes it easier to empathize with the unrequited lover . \\nbut here the fianc ? is a decent , ordinary guy , and although slim would like to feel anger , he cannot . \\nthe fianc ? has done nothing wrong ; the situation is the result of bad luck or bad decisions , take your pick . \\neight taels has its share of flaws ( the early sequences in america and on the plane to china are especially weak ) , but it compensates with insight . \\nwhen odds-and-ends tells slim that her future husband wants to move to san francisco , she notes resignedly , \" it\\'s all the same . \\nwherever we go , we\\'ll be in chinatown , \" and her straightforward statement expresses much . \\nthere is insight , too , in the understanding of the consequences of slim and odds-and-ends\\' decisions : he to move to america , she to marry a chinese-american . \\nboth their choices were perhaps born of impatience , perhaps of a sense that the grass is always greener--and it turns out that both choices were wrong . \\nbut they cannot undo them ; they must live with what they have done . \\nsuch is life . \\nthe movie is tender toward these people , but it offers no false comforts . \\neverything that is right and true about eight taels comes together in one great scene , which is the culmination of the love story . \\nslim and odds-and-ends sit in a secluded spot and talk hesitantly , with the muted pop-pop of fireworks exploding in the night behind them , and it seems the conversation will lead to a kiss . \\nthe exchange that follows , and what slim then does , is poignant and perfect : with clarity and understatement , we see two people\\'s lives , their heartbreaks and virtues , summed up in a single moment . \\nyes , the film is flawed , but moments like that justify most of its inadequacies . \\n',\n",

\" \\nfor the first time . \\nso begins our tale of obsession . . . \\nor . . . something . \\nthe rest of the movie involves ewan mcgregor\\'s eye character following ashley judd around to every corner of the united states , totally and completely obsessed by this woman from afar . \\nthroughout his entire professional life , he has been a voyeur ; so when he falls for someone , the only way he can handle it is to watch and drool through telescopes and cameras . \\nfine , that\\'s a lovely premise , i suppose . \\nbut gosh darn it , if you\\'re going to go there , you better have some sort of explanation . \\nand that\\'s precisely where this film fails . \\nthis is the kind of movie that pisses me off . \\nit\\'s an abortion , a collection of half-formed and wasted ideas that amounts to absolutely nothing in the end . \\nit pretends it is something that it is not - a surreal and deep psychological character study wrapped in a high-tech thriller . \\nhere , the filmmakers have confused \" surreal \" and \" deep \" with \" vaguely unclear \" and \" crammed full of insultingly obvious metaphors . \" \\ni never , even for an instant , had the foggiest idea why eye would fall so in \" love \" with this woman who changes wigs and kills people . \\nthe movie offers only two explanations , neither of which make a lick of sense . \\nexplanation number one : the obnoxious presence of eye\\'s imaginary daughter , who was taken away from him by his wife some time ago , tells him he shouldn\\'t leave ms . judd . \\nexplanation two , which by the end of the film has been beaten into our heads through imagery and dialog and even the title of the movie : \" beauty is in the eye of the beholder . \" \\nwhoo hoo , that helps , thanks a bunch , case closed . \\nthat\\'s as deep as it gets , folks . \\nthere is an attempt at an explanation in the final minutes , which , instead of tying everything together , ends up being as profound as a clever sixth-grade mad lib . \\nthere are secondary characters that move in and out of the picture and serve little or no purpose except to make the audience wonder what the hell the point was . \\nmy personal favorites include : the prison-matron modeled after austin powers\\' frau farbissina , who apparently taught ms . judd everything she knows about wearing wigs ; jason priestley\\'s awfully played dirty desert vagrant #1 , who tries to emulate dennis hopper a la blue velvet , but fails miserably ; and the cop-who-sees-ashley-fleeing-an-accident-scene-and- then-wants-to-pay-for-sex- but-is-shot . \\neach one in this sad little parade is a little more pointless than the last . \\nthe script pays no attention to the laws of time and space . \\nany time one of the frequent location changes occurs , the camera zooms in on a souvenir snow globe , and minutes , weeks , or years could have passed . \\nbewilderingly inane stylistic decisions plague the whole affair - one character passes a glass of cognac to another in a slow-motion close-up awash in a lot of bass . \\newan mcgregor at one point takes up residence in a bell tower just so he could be repeatedly awakened and deafened by the giant bell . \\njason priestly starts philosophizing about sharks , then laughs maniacally . . . \\ncut to random guy with eye patch . . . \\niguana out of focus . . . \\niguana comes into focus . \\nwow , man . \\nwhen i found out afterward that this film was based on a novel , it came as no surprise to me . \\nthere are plenty of elements here that , if extended and fleshed out more , would have made for a decent story . \\nand i wouldn\\'t be surprised if i found out there was an hour and a half of footage cut from this movie lying in a landfill somewhere , or waiting in the wings for the dvd special director\\'s cut . . . \\nnot that anything would ever possess me to purchase such a thing to find out what i was missing . \\nthe last ten or so minutes featured a conversation between the eye and the judd that was supposed to be some sort of revealing exposition . \\nsome guy in the back of the theater was talking on his cell phone , and this time i didn\\'t particularly care all that much because what was happening on the screen was a steaming pile of unholy crap ; the audience around me chuckled and whispered sentiments similar to what i was thinking . \\nsomeone near cell-phone-guy did eventually yell , \" shut the hell up !

\\nthen there\\'s \" caligula . \" \\nthis film features incest , necrophilia , beastuality , anal rape , homosexual felatio of both sexes , elaborate and lengthy orgies , a greased-up fist forced up a man\\'s rear , wine poured down a man who\\'s had his urinary tracts tied off , a penis chopped off and fed to hungry dogs , etc , etc , etc . this could very well be a respectable film , and if could have been had the following not occurred : a ) the events were graphically shot in clear view ; b ) the tone was not that of trying to shock comically but to , well , show \" historical accuracy ; \" c ) the film was a 20 million dollar production with lavish sets , a rather impressive cast , and a whopping 2 1/2 hour running time . \\nproduced and funded by none other than bob guccione , owner of penthouse magazine , \" caligula \" comes across as the most hysterical dramatic picture since \" plan 9 from outer space \" because underneath there\\'s a sense that everything this film is doing is not only accurate and justified , but also brilliantly entertaining . \\nafter all , it\\'s not really the fact that this film features the aforementioned disgusting moments , but that it actually believes in them as dramatic weaponry . \\nno film should be discarded because its content , because film is never about what it\\'s about , it\\'s about how it\\'s about ( as the old cliche goes ) . \\nthose who bash this film for content are glancing over the biggest and most obvious problem with \" caligula , \" and that\\'s that it\\'s nothing but overdramaticized bullshit from start to finish , without a second of credibility in its mammoth running time . \\n \" caligula \" allegedly tells the true story of the evil roman emporer of the same name , a man who was so insanely decadent that his assasination came as a blessing . . . or \\nso i guess , even though almost every single roman emporer was assasinated as well and for much the same reasons . \\nthe film opens on the wrong note , of course , with a quote from mark appearing before any image graces the screen , using the over-used passage \" what shall it profit a man if he should gain the whole world an dlose his own soul , \" depite the fact that the opening scene of the film is of the emporer before he was an emporer , fucking around with his own sister in a field ( i suppose if one has to lose their soul , one has to have a soul in the first place ) . \\nthe plot is so incomprehensibly done that all i or anyone else can make out of it is that caligula ( disastrously played by the great malcom mcdowell , a performance that does the opposite that his performance in \" a clockwork orange \" did ) is next in line for the throne but can\\'t wait for the current emporer , tiberius ( peter o\\' toole - ditto , only for his performance in \" lawrence of arabia \" ) , his grandfather , to die . . . so he kills him and ascends to the throne . \\nthen he abuses his position , marries a woman ( helen mirren , who retains her dignity as an actor by not exactly acting ) so he doesn\\'t just have to sleep with his sister ( a dreadful teresa ann savoy , there to be pretty , naked , and willing to hop in the sack with mac or anyone he asks her to hop in with ) , abuses his position a little more , a little more , and a little more , and then , i believe , invades england , then is killed off . \\nthe filler , instead of recounting his life , is supposed to be , as guccione claims , the ultimate portrait of decadent pagan rome , complete with orgies , vicious deaths , and lots of nudity . \\nbut instead of being the historical accurate film it really really wants to be , it instead becomes guccione\\'s twisted masturbatory image of what it could be like . \\noh , isn\\'t it great that they just loved having sex ? \\nand that they killed people so disgustingly ? \\nand wouldn\\'t it be great if i could make a couple bucks by selling this shit off as accuracy even though it\\'s so blatantly real bad porn that i\\'ve completely convinced myself that it\\'s not . \\ni mean , why not just show a roman orgy when i can spend a good ten minutes examining every single facet that makes it up . \\nand it\\'s not just that it\\'s disgusting or vile or whatever adjective you want to use to describe this film - it\\'s that in a film where the entire feel it\\'s going for isn\\'t felt , it\\'s also the sloppiest expensive movie of all time . \\nthe sets are lavish , but so blatantly innacurate that i wonder if no historian wanting to have his name on this film explains this . \\nbut that doesn\\'t matter since the cinematography is so dark that you wonder if a light meter was used at all , making this not only dark and ugly , but just plain dark . \\nthe camera operation is also the worst i\\'ve ever seen in my entire life . \\nnot only does this film hold the record for the most unnecessary zooms in one single shot ever , but often the camera will lose its subjects and pan around till they find them , then have them out of focus . \\nthe editing is so sloppy that some scenes are absolutely impossible to follow . \\nthere is no writer to speak of ( what the hell does it mean that it\\'s \" adapted from an original screenplay by gore vidal ? \" ) , but nevertheless , the dialogue is shit , so laughably bad that i can\\'t in good faith believe that anyone with an iq over 5 could say them with a straight face ( my favorite being the line when caligula inquires the doctor about the health of the dying tiberius : \" he could go at any moment , but with care , he could last a year or so . \" ) \\nthe music in this film is mostly prokofiev and khachaturian ( they use his gorgeous \" adagio of spartacus and phrygia , \" ad nauseum ) , used in an attempt to give the film some emotion , but instead feels as if it was shipped in from elsewhere . \\nthe orgy scenes ( and one infamous lesbo scene between penthouse pets lori wagner and aneeka dilorenzo ) are the result of reshoots by guccione himself , which are so obviously removed from everything else in this film that it only adds to the embrassment ( every five seconds or so , the film cuts to random nudity , as if it was afraid its audience would forget this film is rated \" x \" ) . \\njohn gielgud represents the only voice of sanity , walking around in his brief role as if he was constantly the mantra , \" i\\'m going to kill my agent , i\\'m going to kill my agent . . . \" \\nand so on and so on , for over 2 1/2 hours , making \" caligula \" about as exciting and enriching as a three hour college lecture class and twice as deliriously annoying . \\nguccione , in his pursuit of historical accuracy has instead made a film that is such a painstaking , arduous task to watch in its entirety that i doubt anyone can sit through an hour of it without irreversible psychological damage . \\nthroughout the entire film , the presence of guccione is easily felt , as if he were standing there at the edge of the screen , pretentiously looking down upon us saying \" look what i can get away with ! \\nand if you don\\'t like this , then you\\'re a prig , and worse than that , you know nothing about history ! \" \\nuh huh . \\nthere\\'s a clear difference between historical accuracy and doing something that\\'s artistically good . \\na film which showed roman decadence as something that was perhaps liberating for some but could not last - that would probably make for a good film . \\nbut using historical accuracy as a licence to get away with any kind of disgusting-for-disgustingness\\'-sake acts is total , total bullshit , and all i can say is that guccione and the makers of this film have lost any kind of touch with either entertainment or eroticism , and have developed a pathetic and sadistic taste for both , judging from this film . \\nthere\\'s a film that came out in 1989 called \" the cook , the thief , his wife , and her lover , \" a magnifcent film by legendary cult director peter greenaway ( also starring helen mirren ) , which deals with graphic sex , heartstopping violence and gore , and even a little cannibalism for good measure . \\nthat film not only never patronized its viewers , but also handled them in a way that was shocking , yes , but also , in a bizarre way , entertaining and totally involving . \\nthere were real characters there in a real situation , and best of all passion and just the right amount of restraint as not to get off on the fact that it\\'s going to be offensive to many . \\nthat film achieved everything it wanted to do , and has since retained a status as one of those cult films that is not only popular but actualy good . \\nand it\\'s everything \" caligula \" might have been but , alas , wasn\\'t . \\n',\n",

       "  b'my inner flag was at half-mast last year when nick at nite pulled \" dragnet \" reruns off the air . \\nsure , i\\'d seen them all at least once , but i could always count on at least a few inadvertent laughs from ultra-serious jack webb when there was nothing else on tv . \\neven though \" dragnet \" is out of circulation at the moment , we webb anti-fans still have the d . i . , a 50\\'s propaganda piece for the military that is almost as hilarious as the famous \" blue boy \" episode of \" dragnet . \" \\nfor anyone like me who got laughs out of webb\\'s rapid-fire speeches and straight-faced seriousness , think of the d . i . \\nas what would happen if sgt . \\njoe friday ever enlisted , because he plays exactly the same character here , a no-nonsense old fart who looks with disdain at the younger generation and loves to give long- winded , melodramatic speeches on any topic . \\nin this election year , i\\'m more convinced than ever that webb and bob dole were separated at birth . \\nthe movie opens in characteristic fashion as one recruit after another knocks on webb\\'s office door and enters . \\nhe gives each one a different series of cranky criticisms before the credits come up . \\nthe \" produced and directed by jack webb \" card pretty much goes without saying . \\nthis is his movie all the way , and after the first twenty minutes of him chewing out his recruits for no reason , i was wondering if there would even be a plot . \\ni certainly would have been entertained by an hour and a half of trademark webb rants , but the d . i . \\ngives us more -- much more . \\nwebb\\'s mission is to make a man out of private owens , the local screw-up . \\nthe captain gives webb three days to convert owens into marine material or , the captain will \" personally cut the lace off his panties and ship him out myself . \" \\n ( whether the \" lace panties \" part refers to webb or owens remains unanswered . ) \\nthis , of course , gives webb an excuse to focus all his crotchety energy on making owens\\' life a living hell . \\nfor those of you who haven\\'t been indoctrinated into the pleasures of webb watching , here\\'s a reprint of a typical monologue of his . \\ni can\\'t duplicate his hilarious delivery on paper , but the words should at least partially convey what i\\'m talking about . . . \\n \" now you listen to me , youngster . \\nsomeday you\\'ll wake up fighting on a beach and you\\'ll pray to god somebody doesn\\'t get killed because of your foolishness . . . \\ni\\'ve got a headline for you : every time you make one of those little mistakes of yours , you\\'re gonna turn around and i\\'ll be standing right there . \" \\ni couldn\\'t write down all the reprintable dialogue from the d . i . \\n ( nearly all of it belongs in the bad movie hall of fame ) , but i tried to include some of the more noteworthy lines , like one from the scene where webb unwinds from a hard day\\'s work by going to the local bar ( where he orders a tomato juice ) . \\nhe meets a woman who , coincidentally , also orders tomato juice but walks away from a typically-stimulating conversation with webb to flirt with his arch-rival , another marine d . i . \\nwebb marches over to the table , gets up in her face and says , \" just what kind of a dame do you think you are ?

\" \\nowens replies , \" a male , sir . \" \\nwebb yells to the platoon , \" this ain\\'t the one ! \" \\nthat such a scene ( along with the rest of the movie ) was intended to be taken seriously defies comment . \\nbut we know it was all presented with the utmost seriousness when a title card at the end thanks the marines not only for their cooperation in the making of the d . i . , but for iwo jima , guadalcanal and every other major battle of the first half of the 20th century . \\nwebb held the military in such high esteem that all the soldiers in the movie ( with the exception of owens ) were played by actual marines . \\nsomeone wanting to parody this movie couldn\\'t do a more comical job than webb did . \\nit makes it all the more ironic ( like raeeyain on your wedding day ) that the man had no sense of humor himself . \\nthere\\'s a scene in the movie where the guys are on their break time discussing something and one of them breaks into laughter . \\nwebb bursts in the room and shouts , \" what did i tell you about laughing ?

ups , nor does he put a lid on the metaphysical confusion : the cinematic demons of \" lost highway \" are out in full force from beginning to end . \\nthis description might make \" lost highway \" sound like a giddy exercise in haywire surrealism , but in fact , while there are traces of lynch\\'s weird sense of humor , this film is anything but giddy most of the time . \\non the contrary , lost highway is a dark and perplexing mystery that takes lynch\\'s previous excursions into murder and intrigue one step farther . \\nthe film does not revolve around a character investigating a mystery ; rather , the character * is * the mystery . \\nthere are recurring and at times deeply disturbing images of suspicion , distrust , and infidelity thoughout the film that seem to indicate a deluded , fractured psyche at the root of all the bizarre goings-on here . \\nwe , the audience , are left to puzzle out whose psyche it is that is driving this ( probably fred\\'s , in my opinion ) and what , in that case , the other characters and events are meant to represent . \\nall of this proceeds , appropriately , in lynch\\'s typically slow-paced , idiosyncratic style . \\nas is often the case , lynch relies on sound , imagery , and mood more than on dialogue and action to tell his story , and in \" lost highway \" it works perfectly . \\nthere are scenes when the camera lingers on fred\\'s blank expression as he drifts uncomfortably down a hallway , or on his pained face in his prison cell while the haunting strains of this mortal coil\\'s \" song to the siren \" can be heard faintly in the background ; nothing is technically \" happening \" in these scenes , yet they present a vivid picture of a man losing his grip just as effective as , if not more so than , the hysterical screaming found in most movie presentations of insanity . \\nlynch\\'s direction and director of photography pete deming\\'s darkly lit cinematography serve to create a nearly suffocating atmosphere of tension and fear that are exactly what is needed for this story . \\nwell , most of the time , anyway - i have to admit that i was a bit bored at times during the section of the film with pete dayton as the protgaonist , which is less inherently interesting and mostly keeps the viewer\\'s attention because of its tie-ins to the original mystery . \\nthe main characters in this \" reality \" - dayton ( a well-meaning but none too intelligent 24-year-old ) , a sleazy gangster ( who for some reason has two names but otherwise is pretty much a stock character ) , and his porn-star girlfriend ( the blond arquette ) - are nothing you couldn\\'t find in any of the two dozen \" pulp fiction \" wannabes ; fortunately , the reappearance of the mystery man as well as some other typically lynchian elements , such as the strained , awkward conversations between pete and his parents , help to preserve the film\\'s spooky , unnerving tone during this stretch . \\nlynch\\'s typically graphic and disturbing portrayals of fringe sexuality , while relevant to the themes of jealousy and adultery , are also somewhat overdone here . \\nit\\'s not exactly exploitative - like almost everything else in this film , the sex is thoroughly weird and creepy and is unlikely to provide any cheap lurid thrills - as much as it is unnecessary and frankly kind of dumb by the seventh or eighth time arquette takes her clothes off . \\nthat said , these minor flaws don\\'t prevent \" lost highway \" from attaining its place as one of the darkest , most unsettling films to hit the screens in recent years . \\nit is a one-way ride down the lost highway of a disturbed mind , and as such it is gripping , intense , and brilliantly effective . \\n',\n",

social turmoil in 1960s practically destroyed the old hollywood , and new authors filled the void , mostly by using hollywood\\'s financial and technical resources to create serious , \" personal \" or \" artsy \" movies . \\nas a result , audience , traumatised of dark reality of vietnam and watergate , didn\\'t want to see the same dark and serious content on the silver screen . \\ngeorge lucas with its science fiction epic was among the first to come into rescue . \\nthe audience responded with unprecedented enthusiasm , and huge financial success of the movie , later backed by supplement industry of toys , books , comics , role playing games and other merchandise , slowly began to change the face of hollywood . \\nserious , adult movies with artistic ambitions faded into oblivion , and were replaced by industrial products of \" blockbuster \" philosophy . \\none of the biggest casualties of that trend was the science fiction movie genre . \\nuntil 1977 , science fiction movies were mostly in b-production domain . \\nin late 1960s , bigger budgets for science fiction didn\\'t look so strange anymore , thanks to the great success of 2001 : a space odyssey . \\nbut the same success coincided with the surge of pesimism , and hollywood science fiction was as bleak as the rest of its production - mostly dark , dystopic movies . \\nhowever , in 1977 star wars showed once and for all that this genre can be inspiration for popular movies , even among the audience that usually doesn\\'t like it . \\nas a result , seriousness in cinematic science fiction began fading away , although some good , dark and cult quality sf and continued to be filmed until early 1980s . \\nafter that , science fiction continued to be considered a synonym for family entertainment . \\nironically , the man responsible for star wars was in its time considered to be member of \" new hollywood \" generation of young movie authors who made \" artsy \" and \" personal \" films in early 1970s . \\ngeorge lucas established himself with the dystopic sf movie thx 1138 , and nostalgic drama american graffiti . \\nboth movies were considered \" personal \" in its time , despite latter one becoming very popular . \\nin a sense , star wars is an also very \" personal \" film , and the thorny way to the final production shows that commercial considerations were against it , not for it . \\nbut unlike many \" personal \" movies of the era , its \" personality \" was in line with the wishes of the general audience . \\nthe plot , set \" a long time ago , in a galaxy far away \" , begins in a time of civil war . \\nthe evil empire is threatened by rebels who want to restore the old republic . \\nin order to quash any opposition , the empire had built death star , superweapon powerful enough to destroy whole planets . \\nthe information about death star , acquired by rebel intelligence , is being transported by princess leia organa ( carrie fisher ) when her ship gets intercepted by imperial cruiser . \\nprincess is arrested by imperial warlord darth vader ( played by david prowse and voice by james earl jones ) , but the information is being sent to nearby desert planet of tatooine via two humanoid robots - c3po ( anthony daniels ) and r2d2 ( kenny baker ) . \\nthose two robots are sold to the family of luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) , young restless man who wants to leave his farm and become space pilot . \\nhis adventure begins when r2d2 escapes , because the information must reach mysterious local hermit obi wan kenobi ( alec guiness ) . \\nold man is actually the last surviving jedi knight , member of the ancient order that defended republic through the use of mystical force . \\nafter some hesitation , luke agrees to join obi wan in his mission to save the princess , while the old man would teach him the ways of the force . \\ntheir small band comes to the colourful spaceport of moss eisely , where they hire the spaceship owned by rogue pilot han solo ( harrison ford ) and his furry sidekick chewbacca ( peter mayhew ) . \\ncritics who don\\'t like the movie , especially those who can\\'t forgive lucas for his contribution to the quashing of \" new hollywood \" , are prone to point the lack of originality . \\non the surface , they might be right ; lucas himself admits that he found a lot of inspiration in the lore of old hollywood - westerns , wwii aviation movies , old sf cliffhanger serials of the 1930s and 1940s ; yet the most obvious element would be akira kurosawa\\'s samurai classic the hidden fortress . \\non the other hand , those who had spent last two decades studying the movie to death would say that the inspiration for star wars went even further - into collective subconscious of western civilisation ( hinted by some mild tolkien references ) . \\nthe others would find the author\\'s element within the story - star wars could be seen as an anti- establishment film ; young , long-haired , easy going , nature-loving heroes are fighting against old , uptight and oppressive forces who use supertechnology in most demonic purposes . \\neven out of its historical or social context , star wars is an impressive as a strictly technical piece of the seven art . \\ngeorge lucas\\' direction is very good , with the clever editing and a well-paced segments between action and dramatic buildup . \\ncharacters are well-drawn and deliver all the necessary ingredients , both for the space opera and hollywood blockbuster . \\nwe have a \" coming-of-age \" hero , damsel-in-distress ( somewhat toned down due to the popular feminist trends of the time ) , reluctant helper , benevolent mentor , diabolical villain and , finally , comic relief in form of two non-human characters . \\nsome of the actors are very good - alec guiness in his most famous role to date , james earl jones whose voice is enough to cause unease , peter cushing as an incarnation of pure evil in human form . \\nunfortunately , the same can\\'t be said for the main leads - among the main trio of mark hamill , carrie fisher and harrison ford , only the last one had the character three-dimensional enough to launch his further acting career . \\nthe thing that looked like the most important segment of star wars phenomena during its initial release was the new level of special effects technology . \\noften comparisons with 2001 : space odyssey , another ground-breaking sf film , were citing the sheer number of effects as a proof of the lucas\\' superiority over kubrick . \\nhowever , the special effects by john dykstra and john stears are indeed impressive , even after two decades ( although 1997 special edition did improve them significantly ) , yet they aren\\'t the most remembered trademark of the movie . \\nthat honour should definitely go to the \" oscar \" -winning soundtrack by john williams , whose work on star wars is probably the brightest gem in his brilliant career . \\nnewer generations of viewers might be somewhat deprived of the enchantment that still holds those lucky enough to witness star wars original release . \\nyet , even if they are immune to the george lucas\\' magic they should watch this film nevertheless , perhaps only to become familiar with something that is essential part of contemporary culture . \\n',\n",

       "  b'nosferatu the vampyre ( germany 1979 ) \\na film review by mike watson copyright 1999 mike watson \\nthis extraordinary re-telling of bram stoker\\'s \" dracula \" by german filmmaker werner herzog deserves the most prominent of places in cinematic vampire lore . \\ninspired by f . w . murnau\\'s 1922 silent film of the same name , herzog\\'s film is a work of exquisite bleakness , an oddly touching tragedy with a beautiful and uniquely haunting quality that lingers long afterwards . \\nthe original full-length english and german language versions of nosferatu have at last received a video release by u . s . distributor anchor bay entertainment , and in gorgeous widescreen prints . \\nuntil now only a shortened english language version of the film was available on video , and only in europe . \\nboth of these re-releases restore the film to its full length , but viewers should still be wary of the english version due to its often stilted dialogue . \\napparently the english dialogue coach herzog had on the set during filming was incompetent , and some of the voices also seem to be dubbed . \\nthe german version with english subtitles remains the definitive one . \\neveryone knows the story of dracula . \\nor do they ? \\nhis story has been so bastardised on film over the years that a brief reminder of the basic plot certainly won\\'t hurt . \\njonathan harker is a young lawyer sent to the gloomy castle dracula in transylvania to do business with a creepy count ( played by klaus kinski ) who wants to buy a house in harker\\'s hometown . \\nupon seeing a photo of harker\\'s wife ( the radiant isabelle adjani ) he instantly falls in love with her . \\nlocking harker up in his castle , he sets off on a long journey to meet this woman whose beauty so bewitches him . \\nupon divining his identity as a vampire , adjani seduces the count and lures him to his death one morning as the sun rises . \\nthat is a story familiar to millions , but herzog has elevated stoker\\'s tale into the realm of - and i use this term a tad reluctantly - cinematic art . \\nnosferatu is as much a meditation as it is a film , shot through blue-ish and white filters and peopled with characters who perform as if they were half hypnotised . \\nthe film\\'s surreal , dream-like quality is utterly mesmerising . \\nthere is much to enjoy , but i\\'ll limit my praise to a few key points . \\nholding the film together is kinski\\'s remarkable performance as count dracula . \\npast screen portrayals , including bela lugosi\\'s famous turn , have largely been one dimensional and tended towards camp . \\nbut kinski . . . oh boy , this is something far more compelling . \\naided by a startling make-up job , he portrays dracula\\'s vampirism not simply as pure evil but as some sort of loathsome disease . \\nthis man is dreadfully lonely . \\nhe lives in utter solitude , shunned by the locals for his hideous appearance and reputation for bloodlust . \\nkinski\\'s portrayal of the count is both creepy and deeply affecting . \\nwhen he dies , you almost feel as if this man\\'s tortured soul has been freed at last . \\nthen there\\'s the unforgettable soundtrack , largely composed by german group popul vuh . \\nit is so eerily beautiful and evocative that it\\'s quite impossible to imagine the film without it . \\npopul vuh are longtime herzog collaborators and play an ancient-sounding kind of spacemusic using piano , chants , and exotic instruments . \\nwhen i first saw this film some years ago i was so impressed i tracked down and bought a number of their albums . \\nthe one i still listen to the most is \" tantric songs \" , from which most of the music in nosferatu is taken . \\nit\\'s a testament to the music\\'s depth that it is as powerful without the pictures as it is with them . \\nthe album is still available on the highly respected ambient and world music label celestial harmonies . \\nthis is a timely re-release by anchor bay . \\nafter francis ford coppola\\'s unscary and woefully overblown version of bram stoker\\'s tale in 1992 , it is a joy to go back to herzog\\'s film and see the amazing things he has done with what is now a century-old story . \\nto some aficionados , nosferatu is quite simply the greatest vampire film ever made . \\nwithout a doubt , it is an unmistakable classic of the genre . \\ndon\\'t miss it . \\n',\n",

       "  b\"disconnect the phone line . \\ndon't accept the charges . \\ndo anything you can to avoid the wretched , melodramatic sisterhood dramedy `hanging up' . \\ni figured i needed to get in touch with my feminine side , and `hanging up' seemed like an ideal opportunity to do so . \\nthe film features an incredible palate of female talent , and the capability behind the camera brought to mind such sparkling gems as `sleepless in seattle' and `unsung heroes' . \\nmeg ryan , diane keaton and lisa kudrow play a trio of sisters who , once separated by career judgments over family ties , must reunite when their father ( walter matthau ) is admitted into the hospital with alzheimer's disease . \\nwhile this may read like an optimum opportunity to rekindle their relationship and reflect with poignancy on the past , the script by sisters delia and nora ephron is exasperating , shapeless dreck teeming with emotional fakery . \\n`hanging up' has the overall effect of a tele-marketer pestering you for two hours , while you don't have the option of doing as the title suggests . \\nfor the first half-hour , the ephron sisters use telephone conversations for a basis of character development . \\nthis is an annoying and ineffective device . \\ncell-phones ring every five minutes , and everyone hurriedly rushes along , leaving marginal time for the frustrated viewer to relate to the sisters' issues and problems . \\nif `hanging up' was an apple pie , then i felt as if we were getting the mere crust of the story . \\ngranted , there are a few genuine and sincere moments in the film . \\nbut they only help to establish that the remainder of the strained emotions are nothing but inferior dramatic muck . \\nthe most outrageous strategy in `hanging up' is that , after a series of largely unrealized attempts at character development , we are expected to exhibit compassion and courtesy toward the sisters as they join for a melodramatic finale . \\nwe are able to identify with eve ( ryan ) , the most open and caring daughter , because she is the one who stayed by her father's side as everyone else moved forward to pursue a impending career . \\ngeorgia ( keaton ) , the eldest daughter , is celebrating the fifth year anniversary of her magazine called . . . . \\n`georgia' . \\nmaddy ( kudrow ) , the soap opera actress , spends time either contemplating her possible path to stardom or nursing her dog . \\nryan's convincing performance and diverting cuteness are two of the more agreeable aspects of `hanging up' . \\nkudrow , so delightfully eccentric as the off-kilter airhead phoebe in `friends' , is totally wasted . \\nditto for keaton , who is serving a double shift as co-star and director - a time slot that can be a difficult priority juggle . \\nher frenzy is apparent . \\nfor a chick flick , there is a distressing lack of chuckles . \\nthe reliable matthau is reduced to chaotic shtick that , given his character's situation , seems more depressing than amusing . \\neven so , the peak form of humor in `hanging up' is represented by some of matthau's nasty quips and ryan's eternal battle to have the aforementioned pooch swallow a pill . \\nthat about accounts for the three or four chuckles you will expel during the film . \\nmy curiosity has suddenly been tweaked to discover how such a promising and star-studded approach could turn so viciously sour . \\nbut really , it's no mystery . \\nthe predictable , melodramatic filth that is `hanging up' is certainly not the fault of these actresses . \\npin it on the screenplay , which attempts to clear up vital issues in three or four minutes , while spending the rest of the running time in an annoying flurry of phone conversations . \\nit's certainly a far cry from what one would label as a rewarding experience , but `hanging up' should have at least been enjoyable . \\nuh-uh . \\nit's a wrong number from the beginning . \\n\",\n",

       "  b'i relish those rare opportunities when a talented screenwriter can make me feel like a fool . \\ni spent the first hour of forces of nature slowly stewing over its grim attitude towards marriage , grousing to myself about its transparently planes , trains and automobiles plot machinations , and waiting for the inevitable hollywood denouement . \\nthis was a mass market romantic comedy , after all , a genre which has been taken over by teenagers and , even in its best days , worked hard to perpetuate the romance = infatuation paradigm . \\nthen marc lawrence did something wonderful , something which made the entire film click into place : he showed me a comic love story about grown-ups . \\nit certainly didn\\'t look that way from the outset , which introduces groom-to-be ben holmes ( ben affleck ) at his bachelor party , surrounded by friends and family whooping over his \" last night of freedom . \" \\nben loves his fiancee bridget ( maura tierney ) , but the doom-and-gloom pronouncements of everyone around him have him questioning the meaning of this \\'till death do you part business . \\nthen , on an ill-fated flight from new york to his wedding in savannah , ben meets sarah lewis ( sandra bullock ) , a free-spirited woman with a string of failed careers and relationships behind her . \\nas transportation troubles thwart them at every turn , ben and sarah begin a three-day southward journey in which their connection grows ever stronger , ben seeing in sarah the chances he\\'s never taken and sarah seeing in ben the stability she\\'s never had . \\nforces of nature gets off to a solid enough start , setting up the characters and the situations with plenty of witty dialogue . \\nben is an ideal role for affleck\\'s easy-going charm , and he plays the straight-laced straight man without forced exasperation . \\nsandra bullock , for her part , is more loose and appealing than she has been in her last half-dozen films combined , avoiding her recent habit of playing any semblance of character depth as moping . \\nthe two performances -- part of a great top-to-bottom cast -- are effective and connected from the start , yet the script\\'s apparent sympathy with the marital horror stories ben hears makes it difficult to enjoy the romance completely . \\nlively and funny though it may be on a consistent basis , forces of nature leaves a bitter taste that feels like self-justification . \\nthe kicker is that those acidic anecdotes serve exactly the opposite purpose , leading to a surprisingly emotional resolution . \\nforces of nature isn\\'t about a man developing a fear of commitment ; it\\'s about a man learning what commitment means _to him_ , learning that it\\'s not what he thought it was . \\nlawrence\\'s script feints and dodges before reaching its happy ending , an ending which is happy because people make the choices that make the most sense . \\nearlier scenes that might have felt like throwaways take on more resonance , and that bitter taste sweetens into something fresh and genuine . \\nthough one too many plot contrivances keep ben and sarah together through the film , and they do exchange the obligatory mutual character analysis of bickering screen couples , forces of nature wraps up so perfectly that you\\'ll end up remembering the humor and the simple wisdom . \\nthat is , provided you\\'re not put off by the ridiculously busy direction of bronwen hughes . \\nfor a brisk romantic comedy , forces of nature comes loaded with some of the most over-directed scenes of the year : teetering hand-held shots , why-not low or high angles , sweeping pans . \\noccasionally the hyper-real approach works , with cinematographer elliot davis creating a world of fantasy romance ; far more often , hughes refuses to let a scene be what it is , covering it with flourishes so thick you almost can\\'t find what\\'s underneath . \\na script this smart and mature deserved a more restrained director , but even hughes\\' excesses can\\'t spoil this unique concoction . \\nforces of nature may restore your faith in romantic comedy as something with the power to enchant , something that can make you happy to be proved wrong when you expect a tale for and about adolescents . \\n',\n",

       "  b'bruce willis and sixth sense director m . night shyamalan re-team to tell the story of david dunne ( willis ) , a stadium security guard who has been having some problems at home that are affecting his relationship with his wife and child . \\non a return trip from new york where he was trying to get a job , dunne is in a horrible train accident that he is the only survivor of . \\nto make things even stranger , dunne has also escaped the accident completely unscathed . \\na comic book art dealer named elijah price ( samuel l . jackson ) , who was born with a degenerative bone disease that causes his bones to be so brittle that they break constantly , has been seeking out someone like dunne his entire life . \\nprice felt that there had to be someone exactly the opposite of him . . . \\nsomeone whose bones would be so strong that they would never break . \\nprice contacts dunne and convinces him to come down to his gallery for a talk where he suggests that dunne could quite possibly be something akin to a superhero from the comic books price used to read when he was a child . \\ndunne doesn\\'t believe him at first , but price assists him in discovering his \" powers \" and helps him hone his craft until he discovers what his true calling really is . \\nwriter/director m . night shyamalan had a tough act to follow with his sleeper hit the sixth sense . \\nhow exactly does one follow up on one of the biggest and most popular thrillers in recent years ? \\nfor shyamalan , the answer must have come as easy to him as nuclear physics does to kindergartners . \\ndoes this new film measure up to his breakthrough box office smash , though ? \\nthe answer to that question is not a very easy one , either . \\nas far as pacing goes , the sixth sense seemed almost interminable . \\nit wasn\\'t until the surprise ending was revealed that i realized the film was actually intentionally ( and perfectly ) paced in order to give the audience ample time to re-connect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached . \\nfor unbreakable , shyamalan gave the film a much more satisfying pace which , in many ways , blows away the film that had come before . \\nthe story moves along at a steady pace and shyamalan\\'s direction is excellent , with the camera almost constantly moving . \\nthere are tons of great shots in the film , not least of which is a conversation that opens the film between willis\\' character and another train passenger . \\nthe shot seems as though it were filmed like we were watching the two talk from between the train seats and the camera steadily glides back and forth between the two actors as they speak . \\nalso very impressive is the film\\'s score by james newton howard ( who also scored shyamalan\\'s sixth sense and the similar film stir of echoes , as well as this year\\'s dinosaur ) . \\nseveral of the scenes are driven by a very catchy beat and help to increase the tempo of the film . \\none of the best examples of this is a scene in which dunne goes into a train station to \" exercise \" his powers . \\nthe music , in combination with the stellar visuals , really go a long way towards making this an incredible movie . \\nif there was any one soundtrack i would make a must purchase this year , this one would be it . \\nthe film also boasts some great performances , including a precocious child actor trying to vie for the oscar throne left vacant by haley joel osment . \\nwillis turns in a great performance as the sad sack dunne , who just can\\'t seem to figure out why he\\'s been depressed for the last few years . \\nhis character almost seems pathetic when we first meet him , but he eventually grows into his own under elijah\\'s tutelage . \\njackson is one of the better actors of our time , and here he turns in yet another great performance as the ever injured elijah . \\nthough his hairstyle is absurd , jackson seems to infuse such a great deal of pain into his role that the mortar board hairdo can easily be overlooked . \\nrobin wright penn\\'s role seems slightly underwritten , but she still manages to get across the intense hurt of her character\\'s need for love from her husband and her desire to make things work again . \\nspencer treat clark , as the dunne\\'s young son jeremy , shows that shyamalan still has a knack for picking young actors , and he turns in one of the most competent performances in the film . \\nout of all the characters , jeremy\\'s is perhaps the most emotional , and clark does a great job with the role . \\nwhere the film does lose points though , is during its \" surprise \" ending . \\nshyamalan has said in interviews that he was going to do an ending that blew away the one presented by the sixth sense , but i found myself saying \" that was it ? ! \" \\nwhen unbreakable revealed its own ending . \\nit\\'s not that the ending is bad , it\\'s just that the ending doesn\\'t quite have the emotional punch that the other film\\'s did . \\nplus , it almost seems like it sets itself up for sequels ( and i won\\'t reveal the ending here , but you\\'ll understand what i mean when you see it ) . \\nessentially , what all of this means is that shyamalan has made another good film with unbreakable . \\nthe only real problem is that the ending doesn\\'t quite fill the shadow left by its predecessor . \\nas long as it isn\\'t held to the standard that sixth sense set ( which it ultimately will be ) , it should be a remarkably well liked film . \\none thing seems clear , though . \\nshyamalan definitely has an affinity for comic books that he would like to share with the world and many comic book fans will also delight the vision he presents in this film . \\n',\n",
       "  b'it is with hesitance that i call \" apocalypse now \" a masterpiece . \\ncertainly , it had the pedigree to be one of the greatest films ever made , with a director known for producing masterpieces with ease , and some of the finest actors of the 1970\\'s . \\nthe plot , an adaptation of joseph conrad\\'s \" heart of darkness \" , was set in vietnam , and the timing of the film was supposed to be brilliant , coming on the heels of the end of the war . \\n \" apocalypse \" certainly has its moments , some of which are the finest in film history . \\nthe plot is fairly simple . \\ncaptain willard ( sheen ) , is a troubled soldier who came back to hanoi for a 2nd tour of duty . \\nhis mission is simple : take a boat up to cambodian territory , and destroy the command of renegade colonel kurtz ( brando ) \" with extreme prejudice \" . \\nalong the way , willard runs into a series of adventures , including one with lt . col . kilgore ( duvall ) , and a strange encounter with playboy bunnies . \\nwillard\\' s four person crew finally make it to kurtz\\' compound , where he discovers kurtz has set himself up as a god among the natives . \\nwillard\\'s experiences with kurtz take up the last half-hour , with a confrontation and eventual ending . \\nthe movie is visually breathtaking . \\nthe battle scenes are exquisitely done , and the score is brilliant , setting a murky mood of darkness that is first-rate . \\nthe collage of disturbing images that coppola presents is at times both astonishing and sickening . \\nthe vast amount of detail poured into every war scene is stunning , and there are many episodes that are deeply powerful which resonate through the entire movie . \\nthe journey to kurtz\\' camp is quite a ride , with psychosis setting in on almost every character . \\nthe most interesting one is kilgore , the lt . col . who cares more about the surf than about the mission . \\nit is at times revolting , psychotic , and incredible , and it is one hell of a movie . \\nthe scenes are bold , inventive , and powerful , and the acting is stunning , especially be sheen , duvall , and fishburne . \\nthe narration is exquisite , as is the mystery of kurtz . \\ncoppola sets about a hallucinatory ride through vietnam , kind of like \" saving private ryan \" on lsd . \\nthe film is jarring in its implications , and psychotic in its execution . \\nthe problems come when the film slows down . \\none of the major scenes in the film , where the boat arrives at the final army checkpoint before they start their search for kurtz , is a colossal mess . \\nthe dialogue is confusing , the lighting is atrocious , and the scene drags on for 10 terrible minutes of film . \\nthe true problems happen after the crew does come into the kurtz compound . \\nthe film slows down to a drag . \\nsheen seems forever captured by a madman , played by brando is a lazy performance that is not deserving of the accolades it received . \\nbrando is in the film for no more than 15 minutes , but is bathed in shadows the entire time , making the last half hour of the film visually pathetic . \\nthe scenes are poorly done , the dialogue is muffled , and the whole mess is utterly confusing beyond all belief . \\nsheen seems to adore this man , but why the viewers are never told . \\nthe entire journey is supposed to be a prelude for a stunning entrance of this god-like kurtz , but the scenes fall way short of expectations . \\ngranted , it has its moments , which are brutally horrific , but the general feeling is one of confusion . \\nbrando mumbles his lines in a incoherent stir , and my feeling was that this could never be a great man , this could never be a man who inspires hundreds to follow him , so why do they do it ? \\nthere are moments of brilliance , but the visual confusion dilutes the power of the scene . \\nthere are too many questions left unanswered with the character of kurtz to have a satisfying ending . \\nthe finest scene at the end is sheen\\'s escape , and his entrace into the temple . \\nhis rise out of the water , with the smoke coming off of his slicked head , is a brilliant 30 seconds of film . \\nyet , you cannot shake the feeling that there is so much more this film could have done . \\nthe psychotic ride is unforgettable at times , and indeed the film on the whole is very good . \\nit is a stunningly flawed expression of film , for it addresses major issues , such as man\\'s mental stamina during bouts of war . \\nbut one still cannot shake the feeling that this film could have so much more powerful , had the character of kurtz been more explored , and had sheen truly succumbed to the fate that the viewer thought he was destined for . \\nthere is too much good material in here not to be called a masterpiece , but it could have been so much more rewarding . \\n',\n",
       "  b\"near the end of frank capra's holiday classic , its a wonderful life , george bailey ( jimmy stewart ) is feeling down . \\nhe has devoted his life to others , and never fulfilled his dream of leaving his small supburb town , bedford falls . \\nstanding upon a bridge above stormy waters , he looks down , contemplating suicide . \\nhe has potential he hasn't fulfilled -- yet , he has done so much for others . \\nas a young chap , his ambition was to leave his hometown of bedford falls . \\nbut times and ambitions change . \\nthings happen , and he's stuck . \\nhis guardian angel is there , and shows him that . . . it's \\na wonderful life . \\nin a whirlwind tour of the town , george sees what life would be like without him . \\nhe learns the moral lesson , that to live is a gift . \\nhis earthly problems are solved . \\nthe climatic scene is a marvel . \\nfrank capra's film is a centenial classic -- watched and re-experienced by every generation . \\nwonderful life is one of the few pictures of times gone by that seems as fresh , maybe fresher , then it did when it was first released . \\nmany films of the thirties through seventies have aged poorly . \\nbut this one is a near flawless example of how well a perfect script and timing can mesh with first-rate acting , wit and suspense , glorious music , and terrific set peices . \\nthe only even slightly dated scenes are those at the begining in which god has a long chat with clarence , george's guardian angel . \\nthey aren't all that bad , but they remain corny and a little out of place . \\nnevertheless , this is one film that deserves its place in time , cinema history , and our hearts . \\nit can be equally appreciated by anyone of any age . \\nhere is one genuine masterpeice , a classic that reaches heights and ambitions near perfection . \\nthis crackling good mixture results in a film which is at once funny , exciting , moving and uplifting . \\nthe film itself is almost a reversal of the life of george bailey -- there isn't too much to it , but capra and the gang ( various screenwriters , composers , actors ) plumet the material to its fullest potential . \\nthe result is a film -- though not at first intended to be pigeon-holed as a holiday film -- that will always be remembered , celebrated , and loved . \\n\",\n",
       "  b'do film critics have morals ? \\nare there any unwritten laws an ethical movie critic would or should follow ? \\nnaturally we don\\'t want to go into a film with any preconceived notions , which is pretty tough but something we all have to accomplish . \\nsecondly , and along the same line , we can\\'t prejudge a film because of it\\'s stars , director , etc . the difference ? \\nwell , in the first one , we\\'d go into a film thinking it\\'s going to be dumb or it\\'s going to be good , and that would affect our viewing ( that movie sounds and looks dumb , so i\\'m not expecting much ) . \\non the second hand , we\\'re simply assuming it will be bad or good because of a personal \" grudge \" against the film company ( it\\'s made by disney ? \\noh , it\\'s just a merchandising ploy then ) , the actors ( jim carrey\\'s in it ? \\nit\\'s gonna stink ! ) , or the director ( who ? \\ncan\\'t be that good ) . \\nthis is more of a biased viewpoint as opposed to a first impression viewpoint . \\nmake sense ? \\nok , but what about comparing ? \\nisn\\'t that kind of along the same lines ? \\nwhen we compare a certain actor or director or even composer\\'s credibility in one film to another they were involved in , is that really fair ? \\nsure , in sequels you can expect and accept comparisons a lot more , but what about jackie brown , for example ? \\nis it fair for me to take the review and turn it into a comparison of pulp fiction , just because quentin tarantino directed and wrote the screenplay for both ? \\ni think it is , and i\\'ll tell you why . \\na good critic should be able to view the film from the \" average joe ( or jane ) \" viewpoint , while still taking into account the artistic integrity behind the film . \\nsometimes that can be tough . \\n \" the acting was superb , but i was bored \" or \" i loved it ! ! \\nit was sooooo cheezy ! \" \\nmight be used to describe a film . \\nthese are contradictions , and a critic has to weigh both sides and come to a suitable balanced critique . \\nbut which is more important ? \\nand which is better ? \\nan extremely well shot and acted film that is boring , or a really amateurish film that you wanna go back to again and again ? \\ngetting back to the point , my philosophy on comparing films being fair works because we\\'re reflecting what the public wants to know anyway . \\nevery average person out there who\\'s interested in this film is likely to ask \" how does it compare to pulp fiction ? \" \\nand so , as a critic , i\\'m already responsible to ask that same question . \\njackie brown stars pam grier , the \" blaxploitation \" heroine from the 1970\\'s , who is likely to make a big comeback thanks to her role as the title character . \\ntarantino\\'s pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travolta\\'s sudden revival in the movie industry , and with talks of an oscar nomination , the same is likely to happen for grier . \\n ( we\\'ve made it thru comparison #1 ! ) jackie is a 44-year-old airline stewardess who brings in extra cash , and probably her main revenue , by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie ( pulp fiction\\'s samuel l . jackson and comparison #2 ) . \\nordell is in the illegal firearms business and has enlisted the aid of louis gara ( robert de niro ) , a bank robber who just got out of prison after serving four years , to help him accomplish a scheme worth a half- million dollars . \\ntrouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) and taken into custody for possession of narcotics , as well as having more money than is allowed in an airport without being claimed . \\nnaturally this proves an obstacle to ordell\\'s plans and , not as friendly intended as we\\'d hope , he posts jackie\\'s bail after she is put behind bars . \\nthe thing is , ordell is in this for no one more than himself , and as we learn from his previous actions , he\\'s willing to kill anyone who stands in the way . \\njackie finds herself in a tight squeeze . \\nordell won\\'t think twice about taking her out if she fails to help him as she\\'s always done , yet at the same time , a compromise with the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell was provided . \\nit comes down to a simple question : would jackie rather face ordell or prison ? \\nwhat ensues is a rich and intriguing example of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out to help : the law , ordell , or maybe just herself . \\ncoming into play is another 70\\'s veteran , robert forster as jackie\\'s bail bondsmen max cherry . \\nmax\\'s obvious fondness for jackie will become a major benefactor in her fight to beat both sides of the system , and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance . \\nalso involved is ordell\\'s \" surfer girl \" girlfriend melanie ( bridget fonda ) , a ditzy sun- bleached babe who spends her time watching tv with a bong in hand . \\nfonda does the best she can with an essentially thin role , but there\\'s nothing more to her , and therefore , she becomes a tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing bouquet of characters . \\nde niro is also wasted in his role as a quiet nobody crook out to score a few bucks for himself . \\nde niro is a brilliant actor , but a character who hardly ever speaks doesn\\'t need a de niro to play him . \\ncompared to pulp fiction ( comparison #3 ) , the characters in jackie brown and very thin and replaceable . \\nin pulp fiction , even the small , seemingly irrelevant characters were wonderful , complete , and lifelike , whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it wouldn\\'t have suffered much with a lesser talented cast , the exception being grier . \\ntarantino wrote this script with grier specifically in mind , so to say that she is made for this role is a reversed truth . \\nsadly , grier too could have received a bit more attention , especially when the story is all about her newly-jarred perception of life . \\njackson teams up with tarantino again , but the chemical reaction isn\\'t as awesome as the first time . \\njules was the rambling , bible-quoting hitman in pulp fiction , and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off . \\nand although jackson is really , really good in jackie brown , i don\\'t think he\\'s quite as irreplaceable . \\nin fact , maybe a new face would have been better . \\njackson could\\'ve remained tarantino\\'s jules , and a new guy could have become ordell , forever to remain so in our memories . \\nsadly , these characters are too much the same , except ordell just isn\\'t as impressive , and putting this in the hands of jackson once again is only going to deter from our fond recollections of jules . \\nanother problem is that ordell is way too focused on in the beginning . \\nthis is grier\\'s film , so why spend so long getting to know a man who will become more of a supporting character as the film progresses ? \\nit not only makes the movie feel a little too slanted , but it makes for a slow beginning because we have to take longer getting to the meat of the story . \\nit is likely that those pouring into the theater to see this film are going to be those anxious to partake of tarantino\\'s quirky dialogue and eccentric directing style , and not so much those interested in seeing a silver screen adaption of elmore leonard\\'s novel \" rum punch \" . \\nfor those movie-goers , don\\'t expect another pulp fiction and you\\'ll be satisfied , for the script oozes with the familiar brash qualities that has made tarantino an icon of 90\\'s film- making . \\nthe directing has toned down a bit , however , yet we\\'re still reminded that this is tarantino\\'s movie thanks to odd split-screen story-telling devices and scenes being replayed multiple times from different viewpoints . \\nso getting back to the question that i began with , this isn\\'t pulp fiction at all . \\nit\\'s good , but it isn\\'t anything that made pulp fiction such a revolutionary effort in the first place . \\nthis is a more conservative tarantino , but not one that won\\'t satiate true fans . \\nif you can realize that this isn\\'t going to knock your socks off , then you\\'ll be happy to at least let it massage your feet . \\nafter all , we all know how much tarantino loves that particular part of the human anatomy . \\n',\n",

       "  b'making a sequel to a widely beloved film is a weighty proposition indeed , especially when the first film is considered by many to be a masterpiece . \\nwhen it comes to living up to expectations , a filmmaker is almost doomed to some degree of failure . \\nfor a sequel to live up to or even surpass the original\\'s greatness is very rare indeed . \\nand whereas \" babe : pig in the city \" misses equaling the greatness of its best picture nominated predecessor babe , it is a worthy companion piece . \\nmore than that , it is a spectacular work of art that deserves to stand alone in its own right . \\n \" babe : pig in the city \" warrants the classification of being recognized with such classics like \" the godfather : part ii \" and \" the empire strikes back \" as being one of the greatest sequels ever produced . \\n \" babe : pig in the city \" picks up precisely where \" babe \" left off . \\nhaving won the sheep herding competition , farmer hoggett ( james cromwell ) and his pig are elevated to fame status . \\na series of unfortunate circumstances and hilariously freakish events leads to mrs . hoggett taking babe from the small country farm into the big city . \\nin doing so , the film transports us into a wonderfully imaginative world that simultaneously mirrors and exceeds the creative design seen in the original . \\n \" babe : pig in the city \" flourishes where so many sequels fail . \\nmost sequels simply rehash the events of the first film . \\nnot \" babe : pig in the city \" . \\nthis is a completely original tale that offers up a story drastically different than the first . \\nalso , by not being content to utilize most of the old characters , this film gives us many new ones to enjoy . \\nin essence , it doesn\\'t attempt to copy itself . \\ninstead , it strives to achieve an originality of its own . \\nand it succeeds . \\nthat\\'s not to say the familiar is absent . \\n \" babe : pig in the city \" retains some of the best core elements and characters from the first film . \\nalong with babe himself , ferdinand the duck comes along for the ride , as does mrs . hoggett ( one of this decade\\'s best and most underappreciated comic characterizations , hilariously performed by magda szubanski ) . \\nthe three singing mice also make the journey , chiming in with their cute high-pitched vocals . \\nthe story structure is also similar as each segment is introduced with title cards read by the aforementioned mice . \\nfrom there , we are guided once again by roscoe lee browne\\'s soothingly deep narrative . \\ncomposer nigel westlake also returns with his whimsical music style that is perfect for cinematic fables such as these . \\nbut these elements are simply the frame that surrounds an entirely new painting . \\nwhile staying at the flealands hotel , babe encounters a veritable ark-full of new animals . \\nmonkeys , kittens , and dogs of various breeds and sizes are some of the new \" urbanites \" that babe befriends , as well as some wonderfully comical pelicans that ferdinand the duck happens to encounter . \\neach character is distinctly unique , some of which are imbued with personal human-like struggles that are endearing and touching . \\nand while this world focuses largely on these animals , we are introduced to two new human characters as well . \\nmary stein plays the owner of the flealands hotel , an animal-loving young spinster who harbors these lost creatures much to the dismaying anger of her fellow neighbors . \\nstein\\'s landlady is a wonderfully odd caricature . \\nwe also meet fugly floom , an old soft-spoken clown who owns many of the animals in the flealands hotel , utilizing them as a part of the act that he performs at different parties and functions . \\nnot having known who portrayed fugly floom prior to seeing the film , it came as an unexpected pleasant surprise to see who it was . \\nso as not to ruin this well-kept secret , i won\\'t reveal the actor\\'s identity here . \\nit was a treat indeed to see one of cinema\\'s legends grace the screen again in what was a superbly gentle and heartwarming performance . \\nthe greatest triumph of \" babe : pig in the city \" is the art direction . \\nsimply put--it bleeds creativity , taking the look of the original film to a whole new level . \\nrestricted primarily to a farm the first time around , this second installment creates an entire city , dazzling us with unique fable-like architecture . \\nbut the stroke of pure genius by production designer roger ford is his use of our world\\'s architectural landmarks . \\ndesigning a skyline that includes the statue of liberty , the sydney opera house , the brooklyn bridge , the hollywood sign and the eiffel tower , ford has created a singular city that encompasses all of our cities ( as seen in the film photo and pre-production drawing to your right ) . \\nadded to that , many of this city\\'s streets are the twin siblings of venice\\'s gondola-trekked rivers . \\nthe metropolis that has sprung from ford\\'s vision is a wondrous sight to behold . \\nit is a world that you want to walk around in . \\nnorma moriceau\\'s costume designs belong in this world , vibrant in color and style equal to that of the ford\\'s landscape . \\nmost of the costumes are imaginatively cartoonish , with the most exotically grand design going to that of fugly floom\\'s clown outfit . \\nandrew lesnie\\'s photography captures these elements with various lighting moods that are beautifully effective in creating the

dark , fearing that the film may have come to be possessed by tim burton himself . \\nwell , to coin a phrase , the reports of \" babe : pig in the city \" \\'s death at the hands of a dark , scary , felliniesque interpretation have been greatly exaggerated . \\ngranted it has its moments of pseudo-morbidity , but all-in-all \" babe : pig in the city \" is the funny and charming adventure that everyone was hoping it would be . \\nwhatever \" dark \" moments it may have can be attributed to director george miller ( the \" mad max \" trilogy , \" the witches of eastwick \" , \" lorenzo\\'s oil \" ) . \\nhaving served as a producer and co-writer on the first film , miller moves into the director\\'s chair for this one , putting his own unique sense of style into this budding franchise . \\nthe story of \" babe : pig in the city \" is an enchanting yarn , but one that doesn\\'t achieve the emotional or character depth of the original . \\nmissing here is the attempt to broach such heady themes as personal identity , an individual\\'s worth , challenging conformity , and one\\'s purpose in life . \\n \" babe \" dealt with this weighty subject matter , creating a timeless fable . \\n \" babe : pig in the city \" should not have rehashed these themes , but i do wish it would have attempted to explore new ones . \\nthis film is not bereft of moral or message as it parallels such issues as urban strife , class differences , sacrificial courage , and so on . \\nbut this film\\'s goals aren\\'t as lofty as the first\\'s , instead choosing to take a more straightforward approach , allowing its themes to take a back seat to an exciting , sometimes intense , fable adventure that is undeniably clever and inventive . \\n \" babe : pig in the city \" also decides against developing a relationship to the level of which was present in the first film , specifically the one between farmer hoggett and babe . \\nhoggett\\'s love for babe , which grew ever so gently , is what gave that film its charming and endearing quality . \\nbest exemplified in hoggett\\'s dance for babe , this moving relationship was truly unique . \\nit is something that i wish would have been present again ( and could have through fugly floom ) , but was not . \\nplease understand , these are not negative criticisms , per se\\' , but simply statements of what i see as the differences between \" babe : pig in the city \" being a very good film and the original being a great one . \\nbut having said that , these observations are minor critiques at best . \\nas an overall piece , \" babe : pig in the city \" is a thoroughly enchanting and entertaining fable from beginning to end . \\nsure , it isn\\'t a great film , but it is an excellent one that possesses elements of greatness . \\nit is a film that is magical with its charm and humor , exciting in its adventurous exploits , funny with its dry wit and cute voices , and breathtaking in its presentation . \\n \" babe : pig in the city \" may not be moviemaking at its absolute best , but it is on level of cinematic quality that is rarely achieved or seen in cinema . \\nas a result , if you choose to let this film pass you by , you will be missing of the year\\'s best cinematic treats . \\n',\n",

       "  b'any remake of an alfred hitchcock film is at best an uncertain project , as a perfect murder illustrates . \\nfrankly , dial m for murder is not one of the master director\\'s greatest efforts , so there is ample room for improvement . \\nunfortunately , instead of updating the script , ironing out some of the faults , and speeding up the pace a little , a perfect murder has inexplicably managed to eliminate almost everything that was worthwhile about dial m for murder , leaving behind the nearly- unwatchable wreckage of a would-be \\'90s thriller . \\nalmost all suspense films are loaded with plot implausibilities . \\nthe best thrillers keep viewers involved enough in what\\'s going on so that these flaws in logic don\\'t become apparent until long after the final credits have rolled . \\nunfortunately , in a perfect murder , the faults are often so overt that we become aware of them as they\\'re happening . \\nthis is a very bad sign . \\nnot only do such occurrences shatter any suspension of disbelief , but they have the astute viewer looking for the next such blunder . \\nof course , in the case of a perfect murder , at least that gives an audience member something to do besides concentrating on the inane plot and the lifeless , cardboard characters . \\na perfect murder isn\\'t a strict remake of dial m for murder , but it does borrow heavily from frederick knott\\'s play ( which was also the source material for hitchcock\\'s version , as well as a 1981 made-for-tv retelling ) . \\nemily hayes ( gwyneth paltrow ) is the wealthy wife of powerful wall street mover-and-shaker steven hayes ( michael douglas ) . \\ntheir marriage isn\\'t going well -- emily resents steven\\'s controlling instincts , and , as a form of rebellion , she is having an affair with a penniless painter , david shaw ( viggo mortensen ) . \\nwhen steven learns of the relationship , he decides to confront david , but his approach isn\\'t that of a typical cuckolded husband . \\ninstead of yelling or threatening , steven offers david a proposal that\\'s too good to resist : for $500 , 000 in cash ( $100 , 000 before , the rest after ) , he is to break into steven\\'s new york apartment and kill emily . \\n ( of course , after getting the first payment , david never bothers to ask how he\\'s supposed to get the rest . ) \\nultimately , i\\'m not sure which of the three main characters we\\'re supposed to be sympathetic to : the cold-hearted husband , who wants his wife dead so he can get his hands on her fortune ; her mercenary lover , who is willing to do the deed for half-a-million ; or the woman , who is happily carrying on an extramarital affair . \\nnot only are these individuals all profoundly dislikable , but they\\'re not interesting . \\n ( it\\'s possible to make a good movie with detestable characters -- see reservoir dogs -- but there has to be something compelling about them , which , in this case , there isn\\'t . ) \\nsteven , emily , and david are all lifted directly from the screenwriting 101 text book on stereotypes . \\nthe actors in this film are obviously just on hand to get their paychecks . \\nmichael douglas is playing the kind of heartless tycoon that he can do in his sleep -- he\\'s gordon gekko with an unfaithful wife . \\ngwyneth paltrow , who was recently delightful and appealing in sliding doors , is simply awful here . \\nshe now has the dubious distinction of have starred in two of 1998\\'s worst thrillers ( the other being hush ) . \\nat least viggo mortensen ( g . i . \\njane ) has a little fun with his part , but then he usually does interesting things even in bad movies . \\nthe thin supporting cast includes david suchet , the star of \" poirot , \" as a police inspector , and sarita choudhury ( kama sutra ) as emily\\'s best friend . \\na perfect murder is a plodding production that generates almost no suspense from beginning to end . \\nthere aren\\'t many twists and turns in the unexpectedly linear script , which makes the ending inevitable almost from the start . \\nit\\'s surprising to see director andrew davis , the man behind the fugitive , involved in this mess , but , like his stars , he too needs to earn a living . \\nit\\'s just that remaking hitchcock , and doing it so badly , hardly seems to be an honorable way to go about getting the dough . \\n',\n",

       "  b'there\\'s more to a quilt than fabric and thread--each patchwork design has its own unique story ( or stories ) to tell . \\nin how to make an american quilt , the first hollywood release from australian director jocelyn moorhouse ( proof ) , we come to understand how the tales of the seven makers imbue their creation with passion and vitality . \\nall the sorrows , joys , longings , sufferings , and loves of these women are sewn into their quilt and , as their bittersweet memories are given expression , one young woman applies these lessons of the past to her own uncertain future . \\nmotion pictures are filled with male bonding rituals ; how to make an american quilt presents a distinctly feminine alternative . \\nthe \" quilting bee \" consists of seven members : sisters gladys ( ann bancroft ) and hy ( ellen burstyn ) ; sophia ( lois smith ) , a woman known for frightening children ; emma ( jean simmons ) , the timid wife of a perpetually unfaithful man ; constance ( kate nelligan ) , who has been having an affair with emma\\'s husband ; anna ( maya angelou ) , the leader of the group ; and marianna ( alfre woodard ) , anna\\'s daughter . \\nthe project they\\'re busy with is the wedding quilt for hy\\'s granddaughter , finn ( winona ryder ) , who has just become engaged . \\nshe\\'s spending the summer with hy and gladys , and away from her fiance , to decide whether a lifelong commitment is really what she wants , and whether it\\'s better to marry a friend or a lover . \\none of the greatest pleasures of how to make an american quilt comes from watching an array of fine performances by an impressive ensemble cast . \\nfrom winona ryder , ann bancroft , ellen burstyn , and maya angelou to minor players like rip torn , claire danes , and kate capshaw , this film is overflowing with realized talent . \\nthe performances are good enough , in fact , to cover up many of the script\\'s weaknesses . \\nhow to make an american quilt is basically an unremarkable , if affecting , tale of love across the generations--a sort of truncated american version of the joy luck club , with a dash of fried green tomatoes added . \\nthere are probably too many characters . \\nso , instead of really getting to know a few of them , we are presented with quick glimpses into a single defining event in each of their lives . \\nwe learn about the root of the smoldering resentment between gladys and hy , and are told the reasons why emma stays with her husband and sophia is so irascible . \\nthere are other episodes as well : the love of anna\\'s life , marianna\\'s soul mate , and a look at the reasons why constance entered into an affair with her friend\\'s husband . \\nthe sum total of these tales is meant to provide the framework for finn\\'s story : whether to go forward with her marriage or dally with a hunky stranger . \\nthere is no emotional epiphany in how to make an american quilt . \\nthe stories are all well-told , but it\\'s difficult to really connect with the characters--their moments pass so quickly . \\nwhile we certainly feel something for each of the eight principals , our emotional investment is tenuous . \\nthere isn\\'t enough depth to pull the viewer in all the way , and many of the personalities and relationships feel half- formed , like a quilt with patches missing . \\nto put it bluntly , while i enjoyed watching this film , it didn\\'t \" do much \" for me . \\non the whole , how to make an american quilt is a nicely-understated drama that has a lot to say about love , passion , and monogamy in relationships . \\nfinn\\'s segment is by far the most compelling , because she\\'s the focal point : her actions are shaped by everyone else\\'s experiences . \\nthe other patches of this american quilt are successful only to varying degrees . \\nif there\\'s a disappointment here , it\\'s that the script doesn\\'t have more resonance , but the privilege of seeing such a fine cast in top form allows a viewer to enjoy this picture even if the story is somewhat conventional . \\n',\n",

       "  b'warren beatty returns to the screens in the funniest , craziest and hard hitting movie in his career . \\nbased on a story concocted by himself , and also written by beatty , bulworth gives a good insight of what beatty thinks of the american government system . \\nbeatty stars as senator jay bulworth , who\\'s going through a nervous breakdown . \\nafter hiring someone to kill him , he completely changes his campaign strategy and tells the honest truth about what\\'s _really_ happening in american politics , much to the annoyance of assistant dennis murphy ( platt . ) \\ninstead of everyone hating him , the american public love him . \\nhowever , inside his party , more people want to kill him than just the hired assassin . \\nand he also strikes a relationship with black girl nina ( berry . ) \\nit\\'s remarkable that this film was released at all . \\nmuch more open than the rather subdued primary colours , bulworth barely gives the american politic system a good name . \\nthe outrageous remarks bulworth makes to his potential voters are very funny , and also somewhat true . \\nit\\'s great that beatty isn\\'t afraid to let loose on a subject . \\ntalking of beatty , he\\'s excellent in the role of the demented senator , clearing having fun . \\nand seeing warren beatty have fun is a rare sight indeed . \\neven in dick tracy , he was the most straighten face actor . \\n ( then again , he was the only characters face we could completely see . ) \\nthe film gives an opportunity for the 61 year old beatty to indulge in some rapping , which he does with gusto ( and also quite well . ) \\nand seeing beatty as a \\'homeboy\\' has to be seen to be believed . \\nit\\'s nice to see that beatty can laugh at himself . \\nsecond best is oliver platt as the flustered , coke snorting assistant , who goes over the top when he finally snaps . \\nhalle berry is fine , and sexy , as the intellectual nina , who comes to like the senator . \\nalso popping up in the supporting cast is paul sorvino wit h a strange accent , laurie metcalf as the exact same characters she\\'s also played , and christine baranski of cybill fame as bullworths wife , who all contribute to the fun . \\nand , this being a political film , the ubiquitous larry king makes an appearance , as , * shock * , himself . \\nthe writing and directing , both by beatty , are above par . \\nthe direction is very nearly sitcom like , but suits the film perfectly , and both the politics are gangland parts are handled well . \\nthe script is funny , and the raps are actually well produced and humorous , and quite clever . \\nthey\\'re not cringe inducing , at least . \\nthe script makes many points about society in america today , and isn\\'t afraid to make any bold statements about what is a flawed system . \\nbest of all , the film is thought provoking , but directed and written in such a way that the film feels as light as a feather , and is very entertaining . \\nthere\\'s also a great rap soundtrack with some well chosen tunes . \\nbulworth is a film with many advantages , and few flaws . \\nperhaps it could be somewhat embarrassing to see a 61 year old man rapping , but beatty does it so well it\\'s irrelevant . \\nin fact , there\\'s very little against bulworth , except for the language which is very heavy , but then again it should be expected . \\nbulworth , then , is well worth watching . \\na david wilcock review ? 1999 \\n \" you know , for kids \" - norville barnes \\n',\n",
       "  b'ralph fiennes is carving out a nice niche for himself in the genre of period piece romances . \\nfor his followup to the academy-beloved the english patient , he has once again turned to a love story , this time directed by accomplished australian film maker gillian armstrong ( little women ) . \\ndespite some obvious overplotting , oscar and lucinda is a mostly effective and often affecting motion picture that touches our hearts while daring our minds to balk at its implausible coincidences . \\nthe film opens in the mid-1800s , with parallel storylines in new south wales , australia and devon , england . \\nas the helpful narrative voice of geoffrey rush informs us , lucinda leplastrier ( cate blanchett ) is a headstrong young woman being raised in the australian outback . \\nmeanwhile , half the world away , oscar hopkins ( fiennes ) has broken with his puritanical father over religious issues , and has gone away to school to study to be an anglican priest . \\nlucinda is fascinated with glass ; oscar is obsessed with theology . \\nlucinda is rich ; oscar is poor . \\nlucinda is forward and self-assured ; oscar is timid and uncertain of himself . \\nyet one characteristic unites these two diverse individuals -- the compulsion to gamble , whether it\\'s on horses , dogs , cards , or the flip of a coin . \\nand fate has decreed that they will one day meet . \\nthat day doesn\\'t occur until 45 minutes into the film , when oscar boards a ship bound for sidney , australia , where he hopes to change his life and minister to anyone in need of his help . \\nanother of the passengers is lucinda , who is returning from england where she was shopping for machinery to equip her newly-acquired glassworks factory . \\nat first , their relationship is that of a reverend and a confessor , but it doesn\\'t take long for both of them to recognize a kindred spirit in the other . \\na friendship is born , and , once they reach australia , it develops into something more potent . \\nbut oscar is uncertain of lucinda\\'s affection , and feels he must do something to prove himself worthy of her . \\noscar and lucinda isn\\'t beyond a little manipulation to get the desired emotional response , and there are times when the storyline curves in preposterous directions . \\non more than one occasion , it\\'s apparent that events are occurring specifically to funnel the characters into a position where there is only one possible route . \\ncoincidence is a crucial plot device ; without it , this movie can\\'t go anywhere . \\nthe voiceover narration ( never one of my favorite techniques ) is too verbose and breaks into the story at undesirable moments . \\n ( however , without it , the final twist , which i will not reveal , would not be as poignant . ) \\nyet , despite these quibbles , i enjoyed oscar and lucinda . \\nstoryline faults pale in the light of two such finely-realized characters . \\nthematically , the film is also strong . \\nthe unifying motif -- that everything in life is a gamble -- is successfully delineated . \\noscar and lucinda don\\'t just wager their money , they bet their hearts , minds , and souls . \\na card game they engage in shortly after they first meet could easily be considered a form of emotional \" strip poker \" where defenses are peeled away to reveal their shared , secret passion . \\noscar does not see gambling as a vice . \\nin fact , he believes that the greatest chance one takes in life is betting one\\'s immortal soul on the truth of a religious faith . \\nralph fiennes , who normally plays strong , confident men , is very much at home as the fumbling , insecure oscar . \\nthe actor brings a variety of nervous tics to the part , all of which subtly add to a vague sense of discomfort whenever oscar is on-screen . \\nas good as fiennes is , however , he is eclipsed by cate blanchett . \\nthe actress , who appeared earlier this year as one of the leads in bruce beresford\\'s paradise road , is mesmerizing as lucinda . \\nshe gives this liberated woman her flash , and feeds the chemistry between the two lead characters so that it sparkles rather than fizzles . \\neffective support is provided by ciaran hinds ( the male lead in jane austen\\'s persuasion ) as lucinda\\'s close friend , tom wilkinson ( the full monty ) as oscar\\'s mentor , and clive russell as a self-serving adventurer . \\nthere\\'s a real magic in the way armstrong develops the story , keeping things moving in unexpected directions without lingering too long on any one moment or sequence . \\n ( in fact , i wish she had devoted a little more time to the luminous middle act , which has oscar and lucinda together . ) \\nwith the skill of a consummate storyteller , she weaves romance , friendship , passion , humor , and tragedy together into a complete package . \\nthe characters , with all of their human foibles and neuroses , are wonderfully developed by fiennes and blanchett . \\nso who cares if the storyline is a little ripe and unwieldy ? \\noscar and lucinda still offers abundant pleasures to reward the viewer . \\n',\n",
       "  b'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \\nbe forewarned . \\non december 20 , 1996 , amidst all the year-end oscar bait releases from the major studios , miramax\\'s genre label dimension films quietly released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream . \\nalthough the teen horror market had been given up for all-but-dead in recent years , the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns , eventually topping $100 million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history , while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre . \\nthe sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry -- suddenly , everybody was looking for hip , inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes . \\nthe strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost . \\nscream director wes craven , previously best known as the creator of new line\\'s a nightmare on elm street film series , was thrust back into the limelight . \\nand scream\\'s rookie scribe , kevin williamson , burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion . \\nit\\'s hard to understate this last point . \\nmr . williamson has , based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing ( scream , i know what you did last summer from october 1997 , and now scream 2 ) , enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame , quickly become the most well-known screenwriter amongst the entertainment weekly-reading , box office figure-watching youth culture since -- well , since that quentin tarantino guy ( whom , it is said , has also achieved some renown as a director ) . \\nindeed , in a singularly freakish oddity , it is the screenwriter , mr . williamson , and not the director that has been receiving the lion\\'s share of acclaim for the success of scream , and the print advertisements for scream 2\\'s theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence : while the traditional \" a film by wes craven \" drapes the film\\'s title in the ads , right below it ( in equal sized font , yet ) reads \" written by kevin williamson \" , an affirmation of the screenwriter\\'s contribution to the project which may be unprecedented . \\n ( i can envision the board of wga , licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of \" a film by \" is attained . ) \\nand , much like mr . tarantino\\'s screenwriting , mr . williamson\\'s work is vaguely unconventional , incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters . \\nin scream , they satirically discussed other horror films ; here in the sequel , the characters discuss the relative merits of film sequels . \\nscream was written in 1995 during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood , and mr . williamson\\'s rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel . \\nwhile the sequel was planned from the outset -- a treatment of scream 2 was included when mr . williamson sold the screenplay for scream -- the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived , and it\\'s only at about the film\\'s midway point when it becomes engaging . \\nlike its predecessor , scream 2 opens with a splashy , eye-grabbing prologue which only vaguely ties into the film\\'s principal narrative ; this time around , we\\'re following the exploits of a young couple ( jada pinkett and omar epps ) attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab ( a running film-within-a-film gag where the \" true life \" events behind the first film has been turned into a movie ) . \\nhowever , although it tries hard and has some good ideas -- the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the one i was sharing the theatre with , and i was certainly thinking about gutting the overly-noisy person a few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes -- the prologue is a pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original with drew barrymore ( where her performance not only convinced me that she * could * act , but was so good that it would rank among the best performances in a horror film that i\\'ve ever seen ) . \\nthere are too many knowing , hip pop-culture references crammed into the scream 2 sequence , and the setup isn\\'t nearly as cleverly frightening as scream\\'s ; while the first film\\'s preface dizzyingly built up to a final shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying , the payoff here is almost campily theatrical . \\nflash to the campus of a smalltown ohio college , where returning characters sidney ( neve campbell ) and randy ( jamie kennedy ) have relocated for their studies and to escape the notoriety from the events in the first film . \\nthe murders which open this film result in reuniting the survivors -- single-minded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) roars into town to cover the breaking story , while ever-awkward former deputy dewey riley ( david arquette ) flies in to protectively guard over sidney . \\nthey\\'re joined by cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , who was falsely accused of homicide in a cameo appearance during the first film ; his role here is significantly expanded . \\nthe film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory , although i suppose a good case can be made that it really isn\\'t necessary -- not because so many people have seen the first installment , but because this is , after all , a sequel to a slasher film : what do you * think * happened to these characters in the prior movie ? \\nthere\\'s a lot of new faces on the scene too : sidney\\'s new boyfriend , derek ( jerry o\\'connell ) and her new roommate hallie ( elise neal ) , randy\\'s fellow film student mickey ( timothy olyphant ) , gale\\'s newly-assigned nervous cameraman joel ( duane martin ) , omnipresent local journalist debbie salt ( laurie metcalf ) , co-ed cici cooper ( ms . buffy herself , sarah michelle gellar ) , and a pair of simpering sorority sisters ( rebecca gayheart and sirens\\' portia di rossi ) . \\nany of these characters could be the killer -- or for that matter , could be the next victim . \\nas is seemingly becoming a regular staple of a kevin williamson screenplay , the narrative is once again framed around the increasingly-flimsy premise of a whodunit . \\none problem that scream didn\\'t have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer . \\nhere ( and to some extent in i know what you did last summer ) , mr . williamson\\'s screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the identity of the killer into a mystery . \\nthe film occasionally becomes so bogged down with misdirection that you can sense it straining at the seams to try and drop red herrings left and right at the expense of its thriller elements . \\n ( it doesn\\'t help matters any that the killer\\'s alter-ego is fairly obvious from the get-go . ) \\nindeed , the finale plays as full-out camp when the villain is finally unmasked , frothing at the mouth with glazed eyes . \\nthis is one of those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations , scheming , and motivation , that you actually get bored listening and just want them all to get on with it . \\nwhile the basic setup and premise for the film is fairly contrived , the aspect where it\\'s head-and-shoulders above its predecessor is in its suspense sequences . \\nthey\\'re staged much more imaginatively here ( save for the first post-prologue murder , which is handled in such a mediocre , conventional fashion that it seems to be culled directly from the predictable 1980s slasher flicks that the first film satirized ) , and are much more fun to watch . \\nit\\'s hard to hold back a smile during a giddy scene where sidney and her companion have to climb over the incapacitated killer in order to escape from a car wreck , and a cat-and-mouse chase involving gale and dewey in a campus sound lab is very nicely staged , although its ultimate resolution is hilariously overblown . \\nin terms of its characters , the strong part of the film is the interesting relationship between gale and dewey ( who ambles onto the screen accompanied by his very own theme music ) . \\ntheir verbal sparring at the outset provides much humour -- an exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of a perceived aura of incompetency is well-written -- and there\\'s a curiously endearing aspect about their relationship amidst all the mayhem and bloodshed . \\non the other hand , sidney is pretty dull here . \\nshe doesn\\'t have any compelling presence , and there\\'s nothing particularly interesting about her this time around to make us care about her other than that she\\'s the returning heroine . \\ngiven this , and the fact that there\\'s no strong second banana character for sidney ( elise neal\\'s role isn\\'t nearly substantive enough to adequately fill rose mcgowan\\'s shoes ) , it\\'s no wonder why the roles for gale and dewey have been significantly augmented for this installment of the film . \\nwhat surprises me the most about scream 2 is its zealousness in decimating its cast . \\nthe film\\'s mounting body count bears out the fact that * no * character is safe ( well , * almost * ) ; while in principal i applaud this bold policy , at some point you\\'ve got to be wondering about just how many characters will make it to the next sequel . \\n ( i was particularly surprised with the untimely demise of one in particular , whose casting for the next installment of the series would\\'ve seemed obvious . ) \\nbut hey , as rose mcgowan\\'s character said in the first film : \" no , please don\\'t kill me , mr . ghostface -- i want to be in the sequel ! \" \\nlook what that got her . \\n',\n",

       "  b'scream 2 has a titillating little scene that lays down the unwritten law of horror movie sequels quite well . \\nduring a film-class discussion , windsor college students articulate what these inevitable laws are , and why sequels never live up to the originals . \\na few rare exceptions are noted , but they left out one . \\n . \\n . \\nscream 2 ! \\n1996\\'s surprise horror blockbuster scream became an instant hit and developed an obsessive coterie of fans which included almost every teenager in america ! \\na sequel was unavoidable , but luckily the re-teaming of writer kevin williamson and director wes craven gives us nothing to fear in the way of lost entertainment . \\nin fact , at the risk of sounding sacrilegious to all the adorning fans of scream , i would say that scream 2 might even be the better film ! \\nsidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , the sinuous heroine who survived a series of murders in woodsboro , ca in the original scream , is now two years older and off to college , majoring in theater . \\nmeanwhile , tv journalist gale weathers ( courtney cox ) , who covered the murders in the first film , has since written a book about the dreadful events ; a book titled \" stab \" , which has been developed into a major motion picture . \\nas scream 2 opens , a crowd of overzealous teenagers are piling into a crowded movie theater for the premiere of \" stab \" , and before long , a young couple are butchered to death , unnoticed in the midst of hysteria . \\nthis marks the beginning of a new murder spree as an unknown \" copycat \" sets out to repeat what\\'s been done . \\n . \\n . \\nand finish what hasn\\'t ! \\nof course the killer is just as obsessed with movies as the killer in the first film , and yes , movies play a huge role in the bizarre psychological outlook the murderer holds as he/she goes about slaying an assortment of gorgeous twenty year olds , but this * is * a sequel , and without deviating from the original groundwork we are still given a fresh outlook on horror movies . \\nthis is in large part due to williamson\\'s deliciously written script , which will easily leave you satisfied . \\nas much as the film condemns the use of cliches , it is riddled with them , but it is done so effectively , and with skillful direction by craven , that you\\'re not bound to complain . \\ni will note , however , that the \" whodunit ? \" \\ndid wind up being the first person i suspected , but believe me , i kept changing my mind as i tried to stay one ahead of the movie . \\nall the actors outdo themselves here . \\nwe\\'re not talking oscar performances , but cambell , cox , david arquette as dewey riley , and jamie kennedy as randy all give surprisingly satisfying performances that go beyond their last outing . \\nthe characters remain true to their roots , and yet show a clear sign of development over the last two years . \\nwe can see how the events in the first film has affected them , but we don\\'t lose any of the luster that made them such a delight to watch in the first place . \\nthe nice thing about scream 2 is that it doesn\\'t seem off-kilter from it\\'s predecessor . \\nit\\'s a natural , smooth , and believable ( as far as horror films go ) transition from film to film . \\nwe skip two years , but there doesn\\'t seem to be any holes or shortcuts taken in connecting the two flicks . \\nit flows so well that you feel more like you\\'re reading chapter two of a book ( long chapters , eh ? ) \\nthan just revitalizing a cast of familiar faces . \\nwhile main characters are usually the only connection in sequels , scream 2\\'s entire plot structure correlates * completely * with the first , making for immediate fondness and absorption . \\nas i said before , scream 2 easily lives up to , if not surpassing , it\\'s precursor . \\nthe only reason scream will likely be hailed above scream 2 is because it was the first . \\nthis doesn\\'t mean that it overcasts the unique , whimsical humor or overall caliber of it\\'s sequel , it just means that scream will forever be known as the movie that mocked it\\'s own while maintaining it\\'s sought-after qualities . \\nif ever a film followed it\\'s original so well , it would be scream 2 , and it makes this a definite must-see for all those unbridled scream fans out there . \\nscream 2 fits snugly alongside scream , and will hopefully receive as many high remarks . \\nit would top off the series quite well , if it weren\\'t for the fact that two movies don\\'t really make a series . \\nit\\'s unlikely to assume that a scream 3 won\\'t appear in the next few years , but if they do decide to turn this into an undeniably acclaimed horror-trilogy , let\\'s hope they can keep up the fantastic work . \\nlike they say , don\\'t mess with perfection . \\n . \\n . \\nbut when a money-making smash-hit is almost guaranteed , who\\'s gonna listen ? \\n',\n",

       "  b\"it's been hours since i returned from the much anticipated sci-fi opus `mission to mars' , and i can still detect the reek of moldy cheddar . \\nwhy ? \\nthe movie is a shoddy cheesefest full of digital eye candy , stapled carelessly onto a flimsy screenplay which somehow manages to leapfrog the great promise of a space opera , instead shooting for the angle of a feel-good science fiction drama more akin to `2001 : a space odyssey' . \\ni got the feeling that most of my fellow movie-going patrons were expecting another `armageddon' . \\nbut no , `mission to mars' certainly isn't one large action sequence about colossal disaster . \\nthis is a supposedly thoughtful , family-friendly space flick in which the apocalyptic excitement takes a back seat to visual elegance and uplifting drivel . \\nyou have been warned . \\nof course , crafting a tightly claustrophobic space drama is not impossible ( see `apollo 13' for an excellent example ) , but few directors possess the skill and craftsmanship to pull it off without seriously scarring their reputation . \\nbrian de palma has enough directorial expertise and visual wizardry up his sleeve to pull it off . \\nwhen he gets his hands on an intelligent , systematically practical script like `the untouchables' or `mission : impossible' , the director has the ability to create a sound technical achievement ( although his overly indulgent style becomes bothersome more than occasionally ) . \\nof course , there's also the inexcusable string of crap that has carried his name ( including `snake eyes' and the notorious bomb `the bonfire of the vanities' ) . . . . \\nall of which makes me want to call de palma the most talented hack in hollywood . \\nthat term may be too harsh , but if i were judging him solely on the perpetual waste of talent that is `mission to mars' , my choice of words would have been slightly less lenient . \\nif i were gary sinise , i wouldn't touch de palma with a 10-foot pole . \\nsinise is a wonderful , wonderful actor , but after appearing in `snake eyes' and this vomit-inducing sham , i'm sure he wouldn't want to risk the embarrassment of a third collaboration . \\nthe academy award-winner plays nasa astronaut jim mcconnell , a man who recently lost his wife ( kim delaney ) and is apparently psychologically unfit for an upcoming space shuttle mission to mars ( oops , forgot to mention the year - 2020 ) . \\nafter a barbecue get-together for the astronauts , we cut to luc goddard ( don cheadle ) and his team , who are already taking measurements and calculations on the red planet . \\nsuddenly , a towering formation of rocks and soil - probably best dubbed a `sand tornado' - appears and creates a whirlwind of suction . \\nfor some reason , the astronauts just stand there calmly to admire this , as if it were a lovely piece of art . \\nthe team is killed within seconds , expect for luc , who was able to send one final transmission and may still be alive . \\nimmediately , a second mission - consisting of astronauts mcconnell , husband and wife woody and terri blake ( tim robbins and connie nielsen ) and phil ohlmyer ( jerry o'connell ) - are dispatched to rescue luc and discover the mysterious secret of planet mars . \\nlet's put the `secret' on hold for now , and discuss the trip there . \\nit is explained , whether scientifically accurate or not ( probably not ) , that a trip to mars takes roughly six months . \\ni'm not sure why the quartet of screenwriters behind `m2m' didn't capitalize on this juicy opportunity of creating tension and claustrophobia . \\ninstead , we join the team during their final days aboard the ship . \\nwhat happened during the five months prior to this ? \\ndid they just play cards and tell dirty jokes ? \\nstill , there are few nicely tense moments ( maybe the only in the movie ) during the time-frame involving a fuel leak . \\ndepalma's direction is quite good in these scenes , although the score by ennio morricone is largely inconsistent ( organ music in space ? \\nc'mon ) . \\nthere's a few good , imaginative ideas in the landslide of cheese , a sad realization that causes me to sigh out loud . \\nit's a colossal bummer that `mission to mars' is poorly assembled and laughably written , with a dubious and supremely silly finale that will only satisfy dedicated optimists . \\nas mentioned before , anyone looking for some disaster-movie carnage is going to feel savagely disappointed . . . \\nmaybe even cheated . \\nafter the unbelievably hokey final shot ( with the words ? the end' somehow adding insult to injury ) , a few audience members made the effort to boo and hiss at the screen . \\nothers muttered obscenities , shaking their heads in disbelief while mumbling `jeez , that sucked .

       "  b'people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels , stories , comic books or movies . \\noften science fiction aficionados find material , previously labelled as science fiction , to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror , or rather simple techno-thriller . \\nin such cases , mistakes are understandable - genre boundaries are never clearly marked . \\nbut , i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic . \\nsuch thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago , when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff , 1983 film directed by philip kaufman . \\nthe mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits . \\nbut the right stuff film isn\\'t even fiction . \\nit was based on the non-fiction book by tom wolfe , covering the early years of american space program . \\nthe plot of the film begins in 1947 when few people heard of edwards air force base , major test site for experimental planes . \\nthe major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach 1 mach speed and thus break the sound barrier . \\nmany pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado . \\nbut one quiet pilot , chuck eager ( played by sam shaped ) succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots , determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records . \\nten years later , soviets have launched \" sputnik \" marking the beginning of the space age . \\nin order to regain national prestige , us government decides to be the first to send man into space . \\nbest air force , navy and marine pilots are recruited into program , but not yeager , because he lacks college education and desired all-american image . \\nin one of critics\\' polls the right stuff was named as one among top 10 films made in 1980s . \\nsuch high position could be explained with the fact that kaufman\\'s film looks quite atypical for its time . \\nwith more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s - age when hollywood used to make films larger than life . \\nbut the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker . \\nphilip kaufman created reputation in 1970s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original , memorable movies . \\nthe right stuff was the last of them , swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual , risk-taking \" artsy \" projects . \\nthe right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film . \\nthe plot is almost non-existent and not very coherent ; the story , featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes , shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots , embodied in yeager , to new generation of the astronauts . \\nthe film also lacks conventional protagonist - yeager ( who also appears in small cameo ) remains the true hero of the film , but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives , making this movie into ensemble piece . \\nthat gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents , until that specialised only for bit or character roles . \\nsam shepard is great as yeager , war hero whose greatest achievement - breech of the sound barrier - remained obscured in history books , probably due to his own modesty . \\non the surface , he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues , but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases . \\nshepard\\'s performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as clean-cut marine ( and future politician ) john glenn . \\nyoung dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper , and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom , superbly played by fred ward . \\nalways reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and ( arguably ) first american man in space alan shepard . \\nkaufman left room for female talents to excel too - barbara hershey , pamela reed , veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots\\' wives . \\nroyal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher , but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vice-president lyndon b . johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch . \\ngreat acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufman\\'s superb direction . \\nmost notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time . \\nthe beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert , as virtual unknowns , far away from strict rules and discipline . \\neverything seems natural -yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world . \\nin that setting , it\\'s quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights . \\nbut the times are changing ; ww2 alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war , and \" natural \" pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined , conventional pilots . \\ntheir entire lives become focus of media frenzy , and their job is subjected to strict rules , meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats , publicity-seeking politicians and uncaring scientists ( like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun , played by scott beach ) only to preserve their most basic human dignity . \\nthis contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence - while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity , \" mercury \" astronauts receive fame and fortune , although some of them even before going in the space . \\nthose contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufman\\'s superb use of poetic movie language . \\nediting is great , and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion ( the same image would be copied in many latter films ) . \\nalthough kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military , which provided authentic locations and period equipment , he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights . \\nthose effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi and real footage of earth from outer space . \\nanother fine contribution of this film is \" oscar \" -awarded musical score by bill conti ; i still tremble from excitement every time i hear it . \\nit is accompanied with the use of holst and debussy . \\nsome of the songs used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period . \\nthis film is great , and its cult status is well deserved , but there are some minor flaws . \\nsome of the \" mercury \" astronauts aren\\'t fleshed out enough ( although being played by fine actors , like lance henriksen ) . \\nfilm also lacks proper closure . \\non the other hand , most logical conclusion of the film - landing on the moon - would require this film to be more than six hours long . \\nalso , some critics were prone to attack this film as too amerocentric and hard on russians , who were portrayed as evil monsters , just in line with most virulent cold war rhetoric of reagan\\'s america . \\nin some of contemporary interviews , kaufman defended that approach by claiming that he wanted to make film as authentic as possible , and in order to do that , he portrayed russians not as they were in real life , but as they were perceived by americans in early 1960s . \\ntime has passed ; now we don\\'t see astronauts as heroes . \\nin this age of widespread satellite communications and routine space missions , those men and women in space suits are seen as mere maintenance workers . \\nfew young boys want to be astronauts when they grow up . \\nbut this film , sentimental reminder of the times \" when future began \" , perhaps could encourage at least some of them to follow \" mercury \" astronauts\\' footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky . \\nand even if they decide to stay on earth , they could still appreciate the right stuff as an extraordinary piece of cinema . \\n',\n",

\\nso damn absorbing that when the film shifts from gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama ( a sub-genre i loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar ) i remained completely and utterly involved . \\nthe film stars treat williams , who gives the kind of performance that should have skyrocketed his career up to the level that brad pitt currently resides at . \\nsince i was hatched a mere two years prior to the release of prince of the city , i cannot provide an answer as to why it didn\\'t . \\n ( though judging from his recent roles in tripe like deep rising and dead heat i would guess that it probably has something to do with quite a few bad career moves ) . \\nlike mickey rourke and eric roberts ( both of whom are currently doing time in direct to video purgatory ) williams is a talented leading man who didn\\'t make it to where he should have . \\n ( if there was any justice in this dog gone world keanu reeves would be the one banished to direct to video hell ) . \\nhere , the actor is given a role not all that dissimilar from al pacino\\'s in serpico ( also directed by lumet ) . \\nwilliams plays danny ciello , a member of an elite squad of police officers who take down drug dealers on the gritty pre-juliani streets of new york . \\nthey work without uniforms or hours much like paid vigilantes . \\nand that analogy is more than apt seeing as how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into using corrupt means to get the job done . \\nthe squad relies entirely on informants ( low level junkies ) to gain access to the big wigs , and in order to obtain the info they seek , they sometimes have to provide the junkies with the junk of their choice . \\ndanny has done this , and though he\\'s a fairly honorable guy , who took the job in order to do good , his intentions have gotten a bit skewed along the way . \\nhe seeks redemption and concludes that the best way to go about getting it is by talking to internal affairs who then convince him to go undercover as a \" double agent \" . \\nhe does so with one condition : he will not rat on his partners . \\nright away we know that that is exactly what he\\'ll have to do . \\nand watching the movie build to that is thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be . \\nundercover cop films are almost innately exciting , even the kind that pull out all the cliches ( like in too deep ) . \\nhow can one not be moved by the issues of betrayal , ambiguity , and the danger in putting oneself in such a risky position ? \\nprince of the city takes all this and charges it with a perceptive , hard boiled script and taut unintrusive direction by old pro sidney lumet , as well as a handful of intense performances , most notably by treat . \\nlumet\\'s greatest contribution to the movie is how he lays back , and lets the camera soak up the action . \\nhis scenes transition rapidly from one to the next building layers of tension , and he rarely holds for reaction shots , instead he clicks away at precisely the moment a character stops yakking . \\nlumet\\'s worst tendency is one that many film makers ( especially oliver stone ) tend to overuse : he relies a little too heavily on actors shouting their lines at each other presumably in order to ratchet up the tension . \\nthis isn\\'t as much a problem here as it was in night falls on manhattan , lumet\\'s most recent cop \\\\ lawyer endeavor , a movie that nearly gave me an ulcer from just watching . \\nthough of late lumet has made several really awful career choices ( maybe he and treat should get together for a drink or something ) , the most recent a completely unnecessary remake of gloria , here he was on , sustaining tension in a film that runs for 167 minutes with not one dull spot . \\nsome of the formula pictures i like the best are the most simplistic . \\nhollywood often forgets how easy it is to make these kinds of pictures even tolerable . \\nof course cop movies aren\\'t popular anymore ( yes buddy cop flicks are popular but those are more like extended sitcoms with gunfire amid the punch lines ) , but just look at the average hollywood action movies , flicks so bloated and full of unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serves no purpose other than to stall the action and demonstrate that our hero isn\\'t gay , the lame comic relief character who\\'s never funny , and on and on . \\nfor all its moral ambiguities prince of the city is a back to the basics cop \\\\ courtroom drama that leaves out all the crap and really thrills . \\nit focuses completely on its story , and its characters all of whom are completely believable from the cops to the lawyers to the junkies . \\nthere\\'s a great scene early on where an irate williams shouts at an ia officer and looks as if he\\'s about to go into one of those corny braveheart inspirational speeches , but instead he breaks down in front of the cop and begins sobbing . \\nthis is a scene that would never make it into a michael bay film ( even though bruce willis sacrifices his life at the end of armageddon , not one damn tear ) it would be cut out because the director would say oh that makes him too human , excuse me , weak . \\nin the very next scene danny speaks in a hushed raspiness , straining to get the words out . \\nhe\\'s lost his voice . \\ndoes that little itty bitty detail matter ? \\nmaybe not to most , but it sure made my night . \\nand in a sprawling epic of corruption , greed , betrayal and violence it\\'s nice to see that someone is paying attention to the little things . \\n',\n",

\\ncasting arnold in a role like this was a mistake to begin with . \\nschwarzenegger is a persona , not an actor , so putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea . \\narnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions . \\nin other words , trying to give him dimension was a mistake . \\nharrison ford , mel gibson , or even bruce willis could have played this role ( they\\'ve all played noble and flawed heroes ) , but not schwarzenegger . \\nthere are several scenes that attempt to establish jericho\\'s character ; one has him contemplating suicide , another crying over the loss of his wife and daughter , and even one in which the devil tries to tempt him into revealing christine\\'s location by offering him his old life back . \\nnone of these scenes really work , because arnie isn\\'t up to the task . \\nthe filmmakers would have been better off making jericho a strong , confident character ( like the terminator , for example ) , the likes of which schwarzenegger has excelled in before . \\nthis one isn\\'t at all believable the way arnold plays him . \\nthe supporting cast tries their hardest , and only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all . \\nas the prince of darkness , he\\'s suave and confident . \\nhe acts like one would expect the devil to act . \\nthe problem is that the script has him doing things that make no sense ( more on that later ) and that undermines him as a powerful villain . \\nbyrne out-performs arnold in every scene they have together ( including the aforementioned temptation bit ) , but this is problematic when it causes the audience to start doing the unthinkable : root for the devil . \\nbyrne\\'s speech about the bible being \" overrated \" actually starts to make sense , mainly because arnold\\'s attempts at refuting it ( mostly of the \" \\'tis not ! \" \\nvariety ) are feeble at best . \\nthe only problem is , arnold has to win , so in the end , nobody really cares . \\nkevin pollack plays jericho\\'s security guard sidekick and tries to liven things up with some comic asides , but like most bad action movie sidekicks , he disappears after about an hour . \\nrobin tunney isn\\'t given much to do except look scared . \\nin fact , all of the supporting players are good actors , but none , save for byrne , is given anything interesting to do . \\nperformances aside , it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it . \\nthis being an action blockbuster , it\\'s no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script , which starts off totally confusing , and when some of it is explained ( and not much of it is ) , it\\'s utterly ridiculous . \\nwhy is the devil coming on new year\\'s eve , 1999 ? \\nbecause it\\'s exactly 1000 years after the year of the devil , which isn\\'t 666 , it turns out . \\nsome nutty priest accidentally read it upside down , so the real year is 999 , so just add a 1 to the beginning , and you\\'ve got 1999 ! \\nif you don\\'t buy this explanation , you\\'re not alone . \\nit\\'s convoluted and silly at the same time . \\nthe method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous ( she\\'s christine , see , and she lives in new york , see . \\n . \\n . ) , and if that weren\\'t bad enough , there\\'s plenty of bothersome stuff in this film that isn\\'t explained at all . \\nwhy can satan kill everyone he passes on the street , but when it comes to snuffing out one drunk ex-cop , he\\'s powerless ?

. \\nhurray for hollywood ) who actually calls the mohr character a \" nigga \" and says things like \" can you feel me ? \" \\nleave it to pay it forward to happily include a little minstrel act for our further enjoyment . \\n ( maybe spike\\'s flick wasn\\'t so misguided after all ) . \\nthese scenes feel as if they belong in a dopey comedy with feel good aspirations rather than the irritatingly saccharine drama that you\\'ll find yourself trapped in should you not heed my warnings . \\nwhile the filmmakers have stressed in interviews that they actually hope this is a film that could make the world a better place , to me the final product has the oily feel of a cynical politician contemptuously reciting cookie fortune slogans to a hopeful audience . \\nit\\'s a picture that looks to be tailor made for academy consideration , with the main players ( all previous oscar winners or nominees ) given big emotional scenes that are practically variations on their most lauded turns . \\none scene in which a slightly de-glamed helen hunt ( de-glamed here means that not only is she a fashion victim [her look is somewhere between goth queen and trailer park mama] , hunt\\'s hair is also natty and badly bleached ) verbally castigates spacey , feels right out of her as good as it gets oscar clip . \\nspacey , of course , responds in his cultured monotone , that could be straight from his low key american beauty performance . \\nmaybe the actor should get an award for coming off the least self consciously irritating ; though how can he not , even when he\\'s emoting spacey seems somehow shielded by a wry indifference . \\nthe usually talented helen hunt is the worst offender . \\nin one atrocious touched by an angel moment hunt slaps osmet , immediately covering her mouth with the guilty hand in that very same stroke , and with said hand still on said mouth , she actually begins convulsing ( dry heaving really ) , then ( and i\\'m not making this up ) she scurries to the kitchen tearing the place apart in a frenzied search for alcohol . \\nthe scene is so hokey it could very nearly be construed as a parody of hackneyed tv movie blow-ups ; it\\'s all very theatrical , especially hunt\\'s performance , which feels like a pathetic plea to the academy for another oscar . \\npay it forward has the dubious distinction of being a film that could be used as an argument for why actors shouldn\\'t get academy awards . \\nthe picture unknowingly affirms that oscars transform nuanced talent into overwrought expressionists . \\neven haley joel osemt , the wunderkind who was nominated for an academy award for his unforced performance in sixth sense , seems more divisive about his expressions and inflections . \\nhis acting has become broader , less intimate ; it\\'s as if we can make out the little munchkin\\'s thoughts : \" boy this outta floor em \" . \\nnaturally osmet is made to play one of those only-in-the-movies children , a martyr-figure who cleans up after his mother , lectures her on the ills of drinking , and even fixes her up on a date with his intellectual teacher . \\nnever mind that the two couldn\\'t be more dissimilar ; his mother is trailer trash dopey , and the teacher is one of those dennis miller-ey intellectuals who hides his insecurities behind a vast vocabulary . \\nnevertheless this little nudnik goes out of his way to bring the pair together in a scene that recalls parent trap-ish cornball antics . \\nbut oh how we love bright , articulate , self-sacrificing children who pick adults up by their bootstraps and guide them through life . \\nthey\\'re so adorable . \\nof course the blame can\\'t all be hoisted onto the actors ( though with the exception of the little kid , they probably should have known better ) , instead the brunt of it should be passed on to mimi leder , who directed one of the most thrilling episodes of er , then went on to make two awful genre films in a row . \\nthe first being the peacemaker , a witless post-cold war george clooney vehicle , and deep impact , one of the two films of 1998 to squander the premise of earth\\'s possible demise by a crazed meteorite . \\nthe first flick was sunk by an over reliance on clich ? s , and a complete absence of any kind of emotional involvement , not aided by an ending which actually centered around the diffusing of a ticking time bomb complete with digital read out ( apparently present for an invisible audience ) . \\ndeep impact has more in common with pay it forward ; it\\'s a movie that treats earth\\'s impending destruction in awfully simplistic terms , completely ignoring the havoc that would so obviously take place if the world believed its planet would be a goner within days . \\nthe film was full of inspirational speeches where people really said nothing , though the sappy score swelled up to make it appear as if they were being profoundly touching . \\nin pay it forward leder continues in this vein with her intermittent dollops of cynicism seeming almost like a rebuttal : \" see my movie isn\\'t as na ?

murray\\'s a stitch , especially when pulling up beside the van ryan limo after winning lombardo\\'s case and flipping them off . \\nand don\\'t leave when the closing credits hit the screen , or you\\'ll miss the film\\'s best part -- four bonus flashbacks that smooth over plot holes while offering a few more tiny turns , plus a final scene that caps everything off with a great stunner of a bombshell . \\nspeaking of bombshells , denise richards , who plays almost every scene in a blue bikini top , does the teen tease thing with a malicious allure that she was never allowed to flaunt in \" starship troopers . \" \\nmatt dillon flexes his sleepy-voiced sex appeal , and pulls off personality changes with chameleonic precision . \\nneve campbell , lovely as ever except when sporting a blond wig , gives suzie a vengeful vulnerability that makes her the most interesting member of the conspiring trio . \\nre-edited and toned down a bit , the dynamics between these three actors could have carried the film to greater lengths . \\nbut what we\\'re given works well enough . \\n \" wild things \" is highly entertaining and , indeed , very wild . \\n',\n",
       "  b'for those who associate italian cinema with fellini and \" high art , \" the son\\'s room is an inventive , subtle alternative . \\nwritten by , directed , and starring nanni moretti , it takes us through the slow , complicated path of bereavement . \\nslow is the best description for the film at first . \\nit takes its time in establishing the habits of what appears to be a normal , happy family . \\nfather and mother both work but still find the time to support their son and daughter through homework and after school activities . \\nthey laugh , spend free time together , and reprimand the kids for innocent wrongs with a sigh and soft pat on the shoulder . \\nyou get the feeling there is open communication and unconditional love amongst the foursome . \\nbut suddenly , the son is found to be dead after a diving accident . \\nthe family dynamics begin an unpredictable descent that gives the narrative strength when you least expect it , but can also be trying on the attention span . \\nthough the film drags and even repeats itself , this can be somewhat excused as influenced by the process of grieving . \\nthough nanni moretti wore several hats for this production , it doesn\\'t come across as a vanity piece . \\none might wish he hadn\\'t picked the profession of analyst for the father , giovanni ( which he stars as ) , if only because this makes his character\\'s reactions so predictable . \\nwhat saves it is a well written script , with spare dialogue and an eclectic variety of human interaction . \\nthe potency of the film lies in the recreation of the tiny details of everyday life that alter due to the death of a close relative , or that remind a depressed person of loss . \\nyou start to take notice of the cracked dishes , ignored when familial bliss was in full swing . \\nyou remember bonding during the routine jogs around the block , and not necessarily huge events like graduation . \\neven better are the role reversals that take place within the household . \\nwhile giovanni and paola ( laura morante ) do check up on their daughter irene ( jasmine trinca ) , there is a sense of being on autopilot . \\nnot only does irene begin to take care of her own needs more , she\\'ll make her parents breakfast in an attempt to crack their new shells to life around them . \\nthese scenes provide interesting portrayals of various coping mechanisms , frequently crossing a boundary as to how much you can help yourself versus others during drastic , unexpected change . \\nrespectfully , gender issues never enter the picture . \\nself-propelled isolation is universal in terms of dealing , so moretti intelligently uses this tool to separate the family . \\nthough giovanni does stop paolo from discussing andrea at a party with friends , there is never a sense that he or she is more stoic , or more correct in the search to restore a sense of a balance to their lives . \\nmost films that broach the topic of death utilize annoying melodrama , speeches , and conciliatory issues to get the waterworks flowing . \\nin contrast , the son\\'s room captures a more realistic depiction of the effects of death on a family by graciously flowing among the five stages of mourning ( denial , depression , anger , bargaining , acceptance ) through each of its main characters . \\nit\\'s not the most engaging 100 minutes , but it is certainly easy to relate to . \\n',\n",

       "  b'i\\'m an avid fan of the \" alien \" saga , so this review is obviously a tad biased ( at least i admitted it ) . \\nof course , that doesn\\'t mean that i\\'m gonna be giving this a four-star review or something , because \" alien : resurrection , \" the fourth film in the cool-as-hell series is not an absolutely amazing film , much like the first two were . \\nhowever , it\\'s a very good film which never fails to entertain , and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series . \\nin short , i had a good time . \\n \" alien : resurrection \" leaves off 200 years after the last one , where our heroine protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , the science fiction genre\\'s answer to job , had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body , waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one . \\nof course , the last one wasn\\'t very great or anything ( i liked it , though not as much as the first two ) , and more importantly , it wasn\\'t financially successful ( a tawdry 55 million bucks ! ) . \\nso back we are , with ripley back as a clone , which means we get another little satirical look at cloning ( not that that\\'s a bad thing , but it\\'s becoming a cliche ) . \\nso she\\'s cloned aboard an even more futuristic-looking ship called \" the auriga \" by some doctors ( including the necessary bad government guy , dr . wren , played by j . e . freeman , as well as the little-seen dr . gediman , played by none other than brad douriff ) , mainly because they have a version of her with the alien still inside her . \\nonce you get past the fact that you can\\'t figure out where they got her blood ( although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one ) , the film\\'s okay . \\nalso on board are a band of mercenary pirates , including michael wincott , ron perlman , kim flowers , raymond cruz , dominique pinon ( a jeunet sytable ) and . . . winona ryder , who plays analee call , who turns out to have a bit of a secret ( i won\\'t state it , but unless you\\'ve been shacking up with salinger for the past two years , you probably know all about it - although it\\'s nicely covered up ) . \\nthere\\'s a bit of a non-sexual-yet-slightly-homoerotic relationship between her and ripley , but it\\'s never really deepened enough . \\noh well . \\nwell , as you might have guessed , the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship . \\nand it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship ( including some shocks - dan hedaya , for instance , who\\'s death is comical yet sad since , well , he\\'s dan hedaya ) , and the remaining people ( about 7 or 8 ) are left to try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth . \\nof course , the plot is all balderdash , and just an excuse for some good old \" alien \" -brand fun . \\nthe real focus of the series seems to be on style , not really substance ( although there\\'s always a bit of it , most notably in \" aliens \" with the relationship between ripley and the little girl ) . \\nwhat\\'s interesting about the series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach . \\n \" alien \" is a claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights . \\n \" aliens \" is a wild , tense thriller . \\n \" alien 3 \" is a bleak , moody piece of semi-noir . \\n \" alien 4 \" is kind of like an off-beat french film , filled with lots of humor , and cool scares . \\njean-pierre jeunet ( without his usual directing partner , marc caro ) creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like \" das boot \" has , with echoes hinting at a possible threat . \\nthe chills in the film are really cool , especially with the music , which is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes ( there\\'s the most tense surgery scene since \" face/off \" towards the beginning ) . \\nand not every chill turns into a bloody mess or anything like that . \\nthis all combined with some good old humor makes this as interesting visually and stylistically as the others . \\nthere are even a couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed . \\none is the aforementioned surgery scene . \\nanother one takes place between call and ripley , which is just awesome . \\nthe underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense , thrilling , and jaw-dropping scenes in the entire saga ( with a small allusion to jeunet\\'s earlier film , \" delicatessen \" ) . \\nand the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool ( with a lovely allusion to \" goldfinger \" ) . \\nbut the best scene in the entire film ( i\\'m sure i\\'m not the first to mention it ) takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her ( she has a an \" 8 \" tatooed on her arm ) . \\nit might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga . \\nthe screenplay by joss whedon is not a great piece of work , as it never really deapens a lot of the characters . \\nhowever , it does make us care about most of them , so that when there\\'s very little of them , and it looks like one or more of them may become alien chow , we are pretty scared . \\nand , yeah , there are some very funny lines ( ripley : \" who do i have to fuck to get off this boat ? ! \" \\njohner : \" well , i can get you off . \\nbut not this ship . \" ) \\nthe acting is good all around , with stand-out performances from ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner , and leland orser ( the poor bastad in \" se7en \" who performed the \" lust \" sin ) as an anxiety-ridden wannabe woody allen who has an alien inside him . \\nwinona ryder is good , but not amazing like she usually is ( although she meshes well with the film ) . \\nof course , and as usual , sigourney weaver steals the show . \\nplaying a variation on the ripley character ( less emotional , and more rude and bitter ) , she pulls it off while still being utterly lovable . \\nshe\\'s not going to get an oscar nomination like she did for \" aliens , \" but she\\'s just awesome . \\noverall , it\\'s a thrilling , entertaining film which doesn\\'t really amaze like the first two , but is much more amazing than the third installment . \\nthe style is the best part of the film , which isn\\'t really a bad thing , but it being the best part takes away from a lot of the depth the film occasionally tries to apply . \\nbut it\\'s entertaining as hell , and it\\'s definitely fit for the \" alien \" series . \\n',\n",
       "  b'wild things is a way to steam up an otherwise dreary early spring day ? provided , of course , that you\\'re the victim of a frontal lobotomy . \\nthere is , in fact , no doubt about who this motion picture is aimed at : movie-goers in their late teens and early twenties -- the most lucrative target group . \\nthis is film noir for the mtv generation : fast-paced , slick , flashy , gleefully mindless , and hollow to the core . \\nwild things is easily one of the five dumbest movies to arrive in theaters during the first eleven weeks of 1998 . \\ni\\'ve seen more convincing drama ( with nearly as much bare flesh ) on that pinnacle of narrative quality , baywatch . \\nwild things wants to dupe viewers into thinking it\\'s a thriller with a real story . \\nwhat it is , however , is a series of increasingly- improbable and shockingly predictable plot twists . \\neverything in between those serpentine moments is filler -- a flash of a breast , a spatter of blood , and some of the most idiotic dialogue this side of a steven seagal movie . \\nthe film tries so hard to surprise its audience that the twists end up being easy to guess -- just take a stab at the most unlikely thing to happen , and that will probably be it . \\nusing this approach , i was right three times and wrong only once . \\nthat\\'s not a good average for a production that wants to keep viewers in the dark about what\\'s around the next corner . \\nthe ad campaign uses two things to sell this movie : the hot , young cast and the old standby , sex . \\nboth have an abundance of screen time , although i\\'ll admit that the film\\'s erotic content is somewhat less impressive than i expected . \\nnothing about wild things is exceptionally risqu ?

he made this film with the straightest of faces , although i have a hard time believing that as production moved forward , he didn\\'t get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming . \\njust looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles - he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper , a mane of hair braided halfway down his back , a wyatt earp-style handlebar mustache , and a pair of thigh-high patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on a cheap hollywood hooker . \\nboorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of \" deliverance , \" which is the only reason i can imagine a studio would green-light this effort . \\nhe attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera , including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth ( \" 2001 \" ) , whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in \" zardoz \" besides the inadvertent humor . \\nsean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971 , and perhaps he was looking for a change in pace . \\nhe got exactly that in \" zardoz , \" and it\\'s a wonder it didn\\'t end his career . \\ni\\'m sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements . \\nis it a treatise about the infallibility of eternal life ? \\nis it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing ? \\nor is it a social statement , something about the inherent negativity of class distinctions and the violence it creates ? \\nkarl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary . \\ncome to think of it , maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip . \\npeople high on illicit substances are the only ones i can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness as anything more than a completely unintentional comedy . \\n',\n",

       "  b'retrospective : city of the living dead ( 1980 ) \\na film review by mike watson copyright 1997 mike watson \\ni once heard someone describe the films of italian schlock horror director lucio fulci as \" dim-witted \" . \\nand by golly , just about all other words fail me when confronted with a dog like city of the living dead . \\nalthough the late fulci managed some rather good thrillers in his career , this is not one of them . \\ntwo points in the movie\\'s favour - the impressive camerawork of sergio salvati and occasionally evocative score by fabio frizzi - keep things from falling totally into the abyss , but by and large city of the living dead is a failure . \\nand like most cinematic failures , it comes down to bad writing , dumb performances and lousy direction . \\nthe story starts in new york when , during a seance , a medium ( katherine mccoll ) sees a vision of a priest hanging himself in the town of dunwich , massachusetts . \\nfor reasons we won\\'t go into here , this opens the gates of hell which must be closed by all saints day or the dead will rise and walk the earth . \\nthe medium apparently dies of fright during the seance , but awakens in her coffin in the graveyard the next day and is rescued by a crusty old journalist ( christopher george ) . \\nthat scene in itself is a howler : why would you bust open a coffin with a large pick axe when you know someone is alive inside ? \\nand don\\'t cadavers have various things stuffed in them and drained out of them before they\\'re buried ? \\nanyway , off the two of them go to dunwich to save the world , where various grisly goings-on are already happening as all saints day approaches . \\nfulci\\'s graphic gore is in evidence once again , but here it only serves to further highlight the film\\'s flimsy script and plodding direction . \\nthe dialogue , in all manner of speaking , is unspeakable . \\nnot bad in the quotable sense , like an ed wood film , but bad in its sheer dullness or blatantly obvious \" lets explain the plot \" type approach . \\nmccoll doesn\\'t have a clue who her character is : deadly serious one minute , frivolous the next , she at times is genuinely hard to watch . \\nand the geezer ( the actor\\'s name escapes me ) who plays the town psychiatrist becomes even harder to stomach than mccoll as the film progresses . \\nchristopher george\\'s performance is salvageable , but he gets his brains ripped out in the end by a zombie and we don\\'t care . \\nin fact we don\\'t care for anyone in city of the living dead , though in other fulci films that hasn\\'t mattered so much when he was on form as a stylist and an ideas man , as he was in the beyond . \\nas a director , some of fulci\\' idiosyncrasies are incredibly silly and annoying here . \\nhe constantly uses extreme close-ups of people\\'s eyes , a ridiculous technique which suggests an attempt to convey the emotion that his dialogue and actors aren\\'t capable of . \\nand despite some gruesome violence , he barely manages a single scare in the entire film . \\nlong-time collaborator fabio frizzi , talented but always erratic , offers a patchy soundtrack that veers between eerie , gothic death marches and woefully inappropriate electro-pop that\\'s quite frankly embarrassing . \\nfulci\\'s other films of this period may be flawed - house by the cemetery , the beyond , the black cat - but they are nonetheless films with more inspiration , atmosphere and better dialogue than this turkey . \\nfor completists only . \\n',\n",
       "  b' ( note : there are spoilers regarding the film\\'s climax ; the election , of course ) \\nwe see matthew broderick , a man torn to a primal state ; he\\'s been unfaithful to his wife , lied to and manipulated his students , and by the same token they\\'ve demeaned his masculinity , his self-respect , his desperate attempt at changing the world . \\nand yet , he equates the cause of his pain , his torment , with tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) . \\nno matter how many students have come and gone , and disappointed him as an educator , she\\'s the real threat . \\nabout to give in , and divulge that she\\'s won by only a lone vote , broderick\\'s mccalister turns in defeat , sees tracy\\'s euphoric celebration in the outside corridor and says , \\'no\\' . \\nthe fact that he simultaneously lusts after her ideologically further illustrates that freudian foundation of entitlement which all men , no matter how obscure , have in their relationships ; a traditional expectation of success , to usurp and surpass women as a proverbial industry . \\nshe can\\'t go higher than him . \\nhe won\\'t allow it . \\nand what\\'s amazing about \" election \" is that every word of that criticism is drawn from a rather opaque metaphor . \\nearly in the film we learn that tracy was romantically , and then sexually , involved with a now departed teacher . \\nit\\'s like payne and taylor , his co-screenwriter , have taken tracy , a girl desperate for friendship , loyalty , and almost perversely drawn the mythological pattern of kids who were so utterly rejected by their peers , that they found sitting at the teachers\\' lunch table more fitting , to an unlikely extreme with her as the protagonist . \\nand it\\'s amazing the compassion that we have ; it seems so real to us , and not merely because it\\'s happened before , splashed all over the front pages , but , because of the all around \" nice \" persona of these people , we easily dismiss the truly wayward deeds of the characters . \\nit\\'s with mandy barnett\\'s \" if you\\'ll be the teacher \" playing winsomely over the closing credits that payne skewers the tenets of his detractors most ; a final , viscous injection of bittersweet irony . \\nsexuality , though , is not the only basis for payne\\'s satire , or its success . \\nit also makes a telling point about politics , friendship , and class boundaries . \\nsatire is required ( or ought to be , anyway ) to take itself seriously , or act so , while the audience does not . \\nit\\'s a fine line to straddle , but some films ignore it altogether ( \" drop dead gorgeous \" leaps infuriatingly to mind ) . \\npayne and taylor hit the right chord ; their characters are real people : neither is perfect , but rather both of the leads are flawed , misguided individuals who retain , somewhat , noble intentions at heart . \\nwe sympathize with them , but still , as a satire , their idiosyncratic behavior , and their wrongdoing , is taken to an extreme for the audience to knowingly chuckle , but also reflect and meditate , about . \\nminus half a point , though , for payne admitting not to having seen \" ferris bueller\\'s day off \" . \\nwhatever . \\n',\n",
       "  b\"seen may 31 , 1999 on home video ( rented ) . \\none of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own , everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise . \\nwith some films it might be just a secondary issue , but with `dark city' what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are , which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully-constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in a movie . \\nthere's an old role-playing computer game called `d ? ja v ? ' wherein the player takes on the role of a man who can't remember who he is , where he is and how he got there . \\nthe goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict . \\nthe premise to this film is not unlike that game , only this time we don't have control over the protagonist . \\nwe begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city ( actually , it's more than just the city , it's the whole reality ) that isn't just that neo-gothic look ( a la `batman , ' `blade runner , ' ) , but is so fully developed it's almost a different genre completely . \\nlater he will learn that his name is john murdoch ( sewell ) , but for now he has no idea what's going on other than the fact something is not right . \\nthe fact there's a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and a mysterious , hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling . \\nthis opening scene alone goes a long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre , horrific tone . \\nthe man doesn't know who he is nor where he's going and it's interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him . \\nin fact , this is the way all stories begin since it's impossible to know the history of a character , their feelings , values , morals , etc . until after we've observed them for a while . \\nbut in this case , the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization , developing the mood and outlining the story . \\neventually , some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is a serial killer wanted by the police . \\nwe met inspector frank bumstead ( hurt ) , a quiet , unemotional , soft-spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time . \\ntwo other important characters are also introduced : dr . daniel p . schreber ( sutherland ) , a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be john's doctor ; and emma murdoch ( connelly ) , a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film-noir movies . \\nit was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film . \\nhe also contacts emma , which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex , mysterious back story . \\nbut absolutely nothing is as it appears to be in `dark city , ' which is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion and vertigo . \\neverything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance - considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot , its lighting , art direction and overall production design , they don't seem to be able to afford any gratuities . \\nhowever , that might also be what's keeping it from reaching its maximum potential . \\nby continuing to follow john as he wanders around this strange place , so much unlike the real world we know , we come to realize that it's all a hoax . \\neveryone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by a race of aliens to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction . \\nbut , as the film's tagline says , `last night , one of us went off . ' \\nfor reasons that are never clearly explained , it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive ( a process known as `tuning' ) . \\nthe aliens , which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin , also possess the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight . \\nat the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made , they awake and either continue where they left off or begin a new life they have no idea they did not have until then . \\nthis premise certainly is interesting and director and co-screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard . \\nhe does provide some explanations such as that dr . schreber is an assistant to `the strangers' because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form . \\nthe aliens mix and match the memories of the city's population to see who will change and who will not . \\nin the process this creates for a good deal of deep , thought-provoking philosophies that could be applied to the real world . \\nhowever , where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart as to what makes a person who he or she is . \\nthe main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened , yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotions it comes off as distant , static and cold ( mediocre performances by hurt and connelly don't help either ) . \\nfor example , john realizes emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond to her , yet in some scenes crucial to the film's plot , we are expected to believe they do have a genuine love for each other , which is also part of the film's climax and ending . \\nand that's what proyas seems to be inferring with the film , but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense . \\nironically , this is what made his first film `the crow' work so well , which had a similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within a nearly identical , dark twisted world . \\nwith `dark city' the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message . \\nstill , the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable . \\nthere's a lot to like here , most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all which accounts for at least half the reasons the film is able to tell the story it does . \\nthe story as a whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in years . \\n`dark city' is what the movies are all about - the escape from the real world . \\n\",\n",

\\nthe backseat ? \\nthe next car ? \\nthrilling prospects , to be sure , but actually , ghostface is at the weary residence , waiting for cotton\\'s girlfriend ( kelly rutheford ) to finishing showering . \\nwhat\\'s missing from this sequence , and indeed scream 3\\'s remaining frights ( most disappointingly , the moment when an ingenue is forced to hide in a wardrobe room filled with ghostface costumes , one of which might spring to life ) , is an elaborate and attenuated payoff . \\nour other surviving regulars have become estranged . \\nsidney ( campbell ) is living a paranoid existence of electronic gates and password-protected locks , while dewey ( arquette ) acts as technical advisor on the second sequel to scream 2\\'s movie-within-a-movie , \" stab 3 \" , and gale weathers ( cox arquette ) headlines a gossipy news program . \\nmurder reunites them , as knife-wielding ghostface stalks the set of \" stab 3 \" , imitating its sadistic screenplay-and his/her/their own personal draft climaxes with sidney\\'s death . \\nthe appeal of ghostface\\'s villainy is that he/she/they could be your boyfriend , your classmate , your next door neighbour . . . or a combination of people . \\nscream was the first of its kind : a slasher mystery , with the guessing game not only entailing who will be next , but also who is/are the perpetrator ( s ) and what is/are his/her/their motive . \\nironic self-reflection aside , parts one and two stand out in a crowd that includes umpteen friday the 13th and halloween flicks because there\\'s at last articulate human beings behind the iconic costume . \\nwith scream 3 , the novelty of ghostface\\'s ever-mutating identity has worn off some , but the character remains conceptually potent . \\nconceptually . the execution of ghostface\\'s master plan this time around is creaky , because screenwriter ehren kruger has invented a new mythology for the world of sidney prescott far afield from what we\\'d come to understand in scream and scream 2 . the movie gets in the silly habit of saying \" all bets are off ! \" \\nin reference to the \" rules \" of a trilogy\\'s third act , but there\\'s a difference between rule breaking and cheating . \\nwith the departure of kevin williamson , who authored the previous screams as well as a tidy outline for scream 3 ( that , for reasons incomprehensible to me , was ignored , save the notion of \" stab 3 \" ) , kruger needed to be reined in tighter , and by wes craven . \\ncraven\\'s direction of scream 3 is lazy in most respects . \\nhow else to explain the jay and silent bob cameo ( the slacker duo of kevin smith movies ) , akin to seeing mickey mouse pop up in mulan and more distracting than funny . \\nit pains me to write this , but scream 3\\'s comedy is generally laughless , with the exception of well-timed performances by josh pais ( as a police detective possessed of the same personality he had as a persnickety teacher in craven\\'s music of the heart ) , jamie kennedy ( resurrecting film geek randy for the sendoff he was denied in scream 2 ) , and parker posey ( through sheer force of will as a b-actress ) . \\nthe visuals are much weaker in part three , as well-the occasional sweeping gesture of peter deming\\'s camera is a pale imitation of the stalking steadicam craven gave us twice before . \\n ( aside : in the wake of columbine , craven toned down the violence significantly for scream 3-why the sanctimony , when scream and scream 2 are still readily available on video store shelves ? ) \\nfinally , marco beltrami\\'s music cues the suspense too blatantly-do you recall the tense chase at the college radio station in scream 2 ? it\\'s mostly silent . \\nsting notes are a whole lot more effective if they spring from nowhere ; here , they act as the crescendos of an incessantly nerve-jangling score . \\ni look at scream 3 as coming from an alternative universe , the same place that birthed the godfather part iii and superman iii-woefully out of synch with its prequels , scream 3 is a nightmare instead of nightmarish , and will likely put the horror genre back in mothballs . \\nthe film unintentionally follows the unspoken rule of a trilogy to a t : ? part three must disappoint\\' . \\n',\n",

it\\'s basically yet another redux of \" the seven samurai , \" with an ant colony under the control of giant grasshoppers forcing them to produce a product for them or else . \\nwhen flik , a bone fide inventor , creates a time-conserving apparatus that accidentally destroys the season\\'s donation , he puts them all in risk , and is sent away so that he won\\'t screw anything up with the pretense that he is searching for help to fight the grasshoppers . \\nhe runs into a group of \" warrirors \" who are , unbeknownst to him , a group of carnival bugs , and they agree to help under similar false pretenses . \\nthese bugs are an equally wonderful assortment to anything in \" toy story \" : foppish walking stick slim ( david hyde-pierce ) , german caterpillar heimlich ( joe ranft ) , quick-tempered and insecure male ladybug francis ( denis leary ) , pretentious praying mantis manny ( jonathan harris ) , his assistant butterfly hypsy ( madeliene kahn ) , spider rosie ( bonnie hunt ) , and two fleas , tuck and roll ( michael mcshane ) , who speak in undiscernable jibberish . \\nthe writers lightly touch on each bug\\'s place in bug society and the malleability thereof while making a wisecracks at everything they can , and blowing the audience away with wild visual treats . \\ngrasshoppers jumping in unison seems like a menacing earthquake . \\na small bird becomes an ominous mortal threat , whose usual mild-mannered squeal is a scream of death . \\nthe bug city is a modern-day metropolis , complete with fireflies temping as traffic lights and a fly sitting on the curb , holding out a cup , with a sign lying next to him that says \" kid tore off wings . \" \\nand a rainstorm is like a giant flood , with each drop acting like a small bomb dropped at millions of miles per hour . \\naround this , the pixar animators stage several large set pieces , like a resuce mission halfway through that is as wild and entertaining as anything this year , and a wonderfully exciting action piece at the end , a chase scene at night through the labyrinthine branches of a small thicket . \\nmeanwhile , each character gets the spotlight to be completely idisyncratic and interesting , something \" antz \" couldn\\'t do , and by the end , over the end credits , \" a bug\\'s life \" pulls it\\'s final punch , out clever-ing \" antz \" with a series of incessantly hilarious faux-bloopers that come just at the right time , when those who leave immeadiately after the final frame of a film have left , and you can brag that you were one of the elite who stayed and got the full money\\'s worth of entertainment . \\nstill , it\\'s no \" toy story . \" \\nthat film , maybe above any animated film i\\'ve ever seen , encompassed almost true perfection in story , character , and wit . \\nit proved that it didn\\'t need to brag about it\\'s cutting edge technology to really soar ( it\\'s the least visually striking of the three computer animated films thus far , but is still the most satisfying ) , and created a perfect world of idiosyncratic delights and innocent fun . \\nyet \" a bug\\'s life , \" as well as \" antz , \" are still amazing films , and prove without doubt , that if you\\'re gonna make a computer animated film , send it to the guys who created these three flicks , evne if they\\'re not working under the same roof . \\n',\n",
       "  b'attention moviegoers : you are about to enter a meaning-free zone . \\nshould the sound system malfunction during your viewing of 200 cigarettes , do not panic . \\nthe film will work just as well as a silent movie . \\nchronicling the meaningless lives of vain , yuppie types , the movie covers the same ground as the wilt stillman films ( last days of disco , barcelona and metropolitan ) but without any of his acerbic wit and the inviting style of his writing . \\nfirst-time writer shana larsen makes the mistake of creating a couple of dozen characters and not giving any of them any depth . \\nthere isn\\'t one of these characters worth caring about . \\nthe movie features such a cornucopia of hot young stars that it looks like a celluloid version of \" people magazine . \" \\namong others , the movie features : ben affleck , casey affleck , david chappelle , janeane garofalo , gaby hoffmann , catherine kellner , courtney love , jay mohr , martha plimpton , christina ricci and paul rudd . \\nand unlike people magazine , the people speak , not that they have anything interesting to say . \\nit\\'s new year\\'s eve in 1981 , and monica ( martha plimpton ) is preparing her big party . \\nstructured as a series of relatively unrelated stories about her guests on the way to the party , director risa bramon garcia flits back and forth among her stars . \\nmonica\\'s apartment is in \" noho , \" an area that one of the guests describes as \" so cool , all of the poor people live there . \" \\ntypical of the shallow couples in the movie are kevin ( paul rudd ) and his friend and would-be sexual partner lucy ( courtney love ) . \\nthey argue about whether lucy is a slut or not since she sleeps with everyone , except him , of course . \\nshe dares him to go immediately to a bathroom stall and have sex with her , which turns out to be neither erotic , funny or successful -- rather like the rest of the story . \\nthe movie gets its title from the carton of cigarettes that lucy gives kevin for his new year\\'s eve birthday . \\n \" cigarettes are a shield against emotional interaction with other people , \" kevin later tells lucy in a snippet of dialog that sounds profound only outside the context of the movie . \\nanother character , played by jay mohr , has a problem with his sexual triumphs . \\nevery woman he beds falls deeply in love with him by the next morning . \\nwhen his latest conquest tells him of her affection for him , his response is \" i like a lot of people . \" \\nas the movie finally draws to a close , the characters awaken from their post-party game of musical beds . \\nsome have passed out early from alcohol abuse and remember little , while others actually have some clue as to what happened . \\nthe movie itself is so forgettable that by the time you reach your car in the parking lot , all trace of the film will have vanished from your mind , which is probably the best thing that can be said about the movie . \\n200 cigarettes runs 1 : 40 . \\nit is rated r for profanity , sex and one dope smoking scene and would be acceptable for older teenagers . \\n',\n",
       "  b'frank detorri\\'s ( bill murray ) a single dad who lives on beer and junk food with no apparent understanding of sanitation or hygiene , much to the dismay of his preteen daughter shane ( elena franklin ) . \\nwhen he uses the \\'10 second rule\\' to retrieve a hard boiled egg from a chimp\\'s cage at the zoo and downs it , he introduces a lethal bacteria into his system . \\ninside his skin , the city of frank is in turmoil thanks to the vote-pandering of mayor phlegmming ( voice of william shatner ) , so it\\'s up to one frank pd white blood cell ( voice of chris rock ) to save the day in peter and bobby farrelly\\'s \" osmosis jones . \" \\nthe city of frank is a brightly animated ( animation directed by piet kroon and tom sito ) cellular municipality where osmosis jones is a typical rogue cop looking for another chance . \\nhe\\'s inadvertently teamed up with drix ( voice of david hyde pierce , tv\\'s \" frasier \" ) , a cold capsule with 12 hours worth of painkillers to dispense . \\nthis quarrelling duo are about to go on a \" fantastic voyage \" in order to hunt down thrax ( voice of laurence fishburne ) , the virus intent on shutting down frank . \\nwhile the animation is certainly colorful to look at , osmosis jones\\' story is a hackneyed one . \\nthe story cries out for puny puns , but we only get occasional sprinklings of wit or bodily humor ( drix graduated phi beta capsule , he departs on a bus headed for bladder ) . \\nneither the hero or villain is particularly interesting ( thrax looks like an animated \" predator \" ) , although hyde pierce is a delightful sidekick . \\nadults can desperately keep their eyes peeled for small amusements the animators dot along the landscape . \\nmeanwhile , back in live action land , bill murray is reduced to nothing more than a walking gross-out joke . \\nthere\\'s no particular enjoyment to be found watching him vomit on molly shannon ( she plays shane\\'s teacher , mrs . boyd ) or hoisting his ingrown toenail onto a restaurant table . \\none must wonder how the climatic flatlining of a child\\'s father will play to the family audience as well . \\nrest assured , the whole enchilada is wrapped up with a fart joke . \\nwhile far less offensive than the farrelly\\'s last effort \" me , myself and irene , \" that film at least spiked some comic highs with jim carrey\\'s hijinx . \\n \" osmosis jones \" will probably be ok for the kids , but the farrellys playing for the family audience is like watching marilyn manson croon a phil collins tune . \\n',\n",
